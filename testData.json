I want to start with a couple of -- I'm going to show some new images, and I'm going to recapitulate\njust four or five. Now, the slide show. I update the slide show\nevery time I give it. I add new images, because I learn more about it\nevery time I give it. It's like beach-combing, you know? Every time the tide comes in and out,\nyou find some more shells. Just in the last two days, we got\nthe new temperature records in January. This is just for\nthe United States of America. Historical average\nfor Januarys is 31 degrees; last month was 39.5 degrees. "},{"time":"06:38","text":"Now, I know that you wanted some more\nbad news about the environment -- I'm kidding. But these are the recapitulation slides, and then I'm going to go into new\nmaterial about what you can do. But I wanted to elaborate\non a couple of these. First of all, this is where\nwe're projected to go with the U.S. contribution\nto global warming, under business as usual. Efficiency in end-use electricity\nand end-use of all energy is the low-hanging fruit. Efficiency and conservation --\nit's not a cost; it's a profit. The sign is wrong. It's not negative; it's positive. These are investments\nthat pay for themselves. But they are also very effective\nin deflecting our path. "},{"time":"07:25","text":"Cars and trucks -- I talked\nabout that in the slideshow, but I want you to put it in perspective. It's an easy, visible target of concern -- and it should be -- but there is more global warming pollution\nthat comes from buildings than from cars and trucks. Cars and trucks are very significant, and we have the lowest\nstandards in the world. And so we should address that.\nBut it's part of the puzzle. Other transportation efficiency\nis as important as cars and trucks. Renewables at the current levels\nof technological efficiency can make this much difference. And with what Vinod, and John Doerr\nand others, many of you here -- there are a lot of people\ndirectly involved in this -- this wedge is going to grow\nmuch more rapidly than the current projection shows it. Carbon Capture and Sequestration --\nthat's what CCS stands for -- is likely to become the killer app\nthat will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels\nin a way that is safe. Not quite there yet. OK. Now, what can you do? "},{"time":"08:46","text":"Reduce emissions in your home. Most of these expenditures\nare also profitable. Insulation, better design. Buy green electricity where you can. I mentioned automobiles -- buy a hybrid. Use light rail. Figure out some of the other options\nthat are much better. It's important. "},{"time":"09:10","text":"Be a green consumer. You have choices with everything you buy, between things that have a harsh effect, or a much less harsh effect\non the global climate crisis. Consider this: Make a decision to live\na carbon-neutral life. Those of you who are good at branding, I'd love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way\nthat connects with the most people. It is easier than you think. It really is. A lot of us in here\nhave made that decision, and it is really pretty easy. It means reduce\nyour carbon dioxide emissions with the full range\nof choices that you make, and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not\ncompletely reduced. And what it means is elaborated\nat climatecrisis.net. "},{"time":"10:15","text":"There is a carbon calculator. Participant Productions convened -- with my active involvement -- the leading software writers in the world, on this arcane science\nof carbon calculation, to construct a consumer-friendly\ncarbon calculator. You can very precisely calculate\nwhat your CO2 emissions are, and then you will be given\noptions to reduce. And by the time the movie\ncomes out in May, this will be updated to 2.0, and we will have click-through\npurchases of offsets. "},{"time":"10:55","text":"Next, consider making\nyour business carbon-neutral. Again, some of us have done that, and it's not as hard as you think. Integrate climate solutions\ninto all of your innovations, whether you are from the technology, or entertainment, or design\nand architecture community. Invest sustainably. Majora mentioned this. Listen, if you have invested money\nwith managers who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance, don't ever again complain\nabout quarterly report CEO management. Over time, people do\nwhat you pay them to do. And if they judge how much\nthey're going to get paid on your capital that they've invested, based on the short-term returns, you're going to get short-term decisions. A lot more to be said about that. "},{"time":"11:52","text":"Become a catalyst of change. Teach others, learn about it,\ntalk about it. The movie is a movie version\nof the slideshow I gave two nights ago,\nexcept it's a lot more entertaining. And it comes out in May. Many of you here have the opportunity\nto ensure that a lot of people see it. Consider sending somebody to Nashville. Pick well. And I am personally going to train people\nto give this slideshow -- re-purposed, with some\nof the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach, and it's not just the slides,\nit's what they mean. And it's how they link together. And so I'm going to be conducting\na course this summer for a group of people that are\nnominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse, in communities all across the country, and we're going to update the slideshow\nfor all of them every single week, to keep it right on the cutting edge. Working with Larry Lessig, it will be,\nsomewhere in that process, posted with tools\nand limited-use copyrights, so that young people can remix it\nand do it in their own way. "},{"time":"13:12","text":"(Applause) "},{"time":"13:15","text":"Where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay\narm's length from politics? It doesn't mean\nthat if you're a Republican, that I'm trying to convince you\nto be a Democrat. We need Republicans as well. This used to be a bipartisan issue, and I know that\nin this group it really is. Become politically active. Make our democracy work the way\nit's supposed to work. Support the idea of capping\ncarbon dioxide emissions -- global warming pollution --\nand trading it. Here's why: as long as the United States\nis out of the world system, it's not a closed system. Once it becomes a closed system,\nwith U.S. participation, then everybody\nwho's on a board of directors -- how many people here\nserve on the board of directors of a corporation? Once it's a closed system, you will have legal liability\nif you do not urge your CEO to get the maximum income from reducing\nand trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided. The market will work\nto solve this problem -- if we can accomplish this. Help with the mass persuasion campaign\nthat will start this spring. We have to change the minds\nof the American people. Because presently, the politicians\ndo not have permission to do what needs to be done. "},{"time":"14:33","text":"And in our modern country, the role\nof logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power\nthe way it once did. It's now repetition of short, hot-button,\n30-second, 28-second television ads. We have to buy a lot of those ads. Let's re-brand global warming,\nas many of you have suggested. I like \"climate crisis\"\ninstead of \"climate collapse,\" but again, those of you\nwho are good at branding, I need your help on this. Somebody said the test\nwe're facing now, a scientist told me, is whether the combination\nof an opposable thumb and a neocortex is a viable combination. "},{"time":"15:11","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"15:13","text":"That's really true. "},{"time":"15:18","text":"I said the other night,\nand I'll repeat now: this is not a political issue. Again, the Republicans here --\nthis shouldn't be partisan. You have more influence\nthan some of us who are Democrats do. This is an opportunity. Not just this, but connected\nto the ideas that are here, to bring more coherence to them. We are one. "},{"time":"15:44","text":"Thank you very much, I appreciate it.

Among her many accomplishments, the MIT engineer received a MacArthur \"genius\" grant in 2004 and was the first woman to win the Lemelson-MIT Prize for turning her ideas into inventions."},"transcript":[{"time":"00:00","text":"In terms of invention, I'd like to tell you the tale\nof one of my favorite projects. I think it's one of the most exciting\nthat I'm working on, but I think it's also the simplest. "},{"time":"00:10","text":"It's a project that has the potential\nto make a huge impact around the world. It addresses one of the biggest\nhealth issues on the planet, the number one cause of death\nin children under five. Which is ...? Water-borne diseases?\nDiarrhea? Malnutrition? No. It's breathing the smoke\nfrom indoor cooking fires -- acute respiratory infections\ncaused by this. Can you believe that? "},{"time":"00:37","text":"I find this shocking\nand somewhat appalling. Can't we make\ncleaner burning cooking fuels? Can't we make better stoves? How is it that this can lead\nto over two million deaths every year? I know Bill Joy was talking to you\nabout the wonders of carbon nanotubes, so I'm going to talk to you\nabout the wonders of carbon macro-tubes, which is charcoal. "},{"time":"00:59","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"01:01","text":"So this is a picture of rural Haiti. Haiti is now 98 percent deforested. You'll see scenes like this\nall over the island. It leads to all sorts\nof environmental problems and problems that affect people\nthroughout the nation. A couple years ago\nthere was severe flooding that led to thousands of deaths -- that's directly attributable to the fact that there are no trees on the hills\nto stabilize the soil. So the rains come -- they go down the rivers\nand the flooding happens. "},{"time":"01:30","text":"Now one of the reasons\nwhy there are so few trees is this: people need to cook, and they harvest wood\nand they make charcoal in order to do it. It's not that people are ignorant\nto the environmental damage. They know perfectly well,\nbut they have no other choice. Fossil fuels are not available, and solar energy doesn't cook the way\nthat they like their food prepared. And so this is what they do. You'll find families like this who go out\ninto the forest to find a tree, cut it down and make charcoal out of it. So not surprisingly, there's a lot of effort that's been done\nto look at alternative cooking fuels. "},{"time":"02:09","text":"About four years ago, I took\na team of students down to Haiti and we worked with\nPeace Corps volunteers there. This is one such volunteer and this is a device that he had built\nin the village where he worked. And the idea was\nthat you could take waste paper; you could compress it and make briquettes\nthat could be used for fuel. But this device was very slow. So our engineering students\nwent to work on it and with some very simple changes, they were able to triple\nthe throughput of this device. So you could imagine\nthey were very excited about it. And they took the briquettes back to MIT\nso that they could test them. And one of the things\nthat they found was they didn't burn. So it was a little\ndiscouraging to the students. "},{"time":"02:51","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"02:52","text":"And in fact, if you look closely, right here you can see\nit says, \"US Peace Corps.\" As it turns out, there actually wasn't\nany waste paper in this village. And while it was a good use\nof government paperwork for this volunteer to bring it\nback with him to his village, it was 800 kilometers away. And so we thought perhaps\nthere might be a better way to come up with\nan alternative cooking fuel. "},{"time":"03:16","text":"What we wanted to do\nis we wanted to make a fuel that used something that was\nreadily available on the local level. You see these all over Haiti as well. They're small-scale sugar mills. And the waste product from them after you extract the juice\nfrom the sugarcane is called \"bagasse.\" It has no other use. It has no nutritional value,\nso they don't feed it to the animals. It just sits in a pile near the sugar mill\nuntil eventually they burn it. What we wanted to do was\nwe wanted to find a way to harness this waste resource\nand turn it into a fuel that would be something\nthat people could easily cook with, something like charcoal. So over the next couple of years, students and I worked\nto develop a process. "},{"time":"03:56","text":"So you start with the bagasse,\nand then you take a very simple kiln that you can make out of\na waste fifty five-gallon oil drum. After some time, after setting it on fire, you seal it to restrict the oxygen\nthat goes into the kiln, and then you end up\nwith this carbonized material here. However, you can't burn this. It's too fine and it burns too quickly\nto be useful for cooking. So we had to try to find a way\nto form it into useful briquettes. And conveniently,\none of my students was from Ghana, and he remembered a dish his mom\nused to make for him called \"kokonte,\" which is a very sticky porridge\nmade out of the cassava root. And so what we did was we looked, and we found that cassava\nis indeed grown in Haiti, under the name of \"manioc.\" In fact, it's grown all over the world -- yucca, tapioca, manioc, cassava,\nit's all the same thing -- a very starchy root vegetable. And you can make a very thick,\nsticky porridge out of it, which you can use to bind together\nthe charcoal briquettes. So we did this. We went down to Haiti. These are the graduates\nof the first Ecole de Charbon, or Charcoal Institute. And these -- "},{"time":"05:05","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"05:06","text":"That's right. So I'm actually\nan instructor at MIT as well as CIT. And these are the briquettes that we made. "},{"time":"05:16","text":"Now I'm going to take you\nto a different continent. This is India and this is the most commonly used\ncooking fuel in India. It's cow dung. And more than in Haiti,\nthis produces really smoky fires, and this is where you see\nthe health impacts of cooking with cow dung\nand biomass as a fuel. Kids and women\nare especially affected by it, because they're the ones\nwho are around the cooking fires. "},{"time":"05:42","text":"So we wanted to see if we could introduce\nthis charcoal-making technology there. Well, unfortunately,\nthey didn't have sugarcane and they didn't have cassava, but that didn't stop us. What we did was we found what were\nthe locally available sources of biomass. And there was wheat straw\nand there was rice straw in this area. And what we could use as a binder\nwas actually small amounts of cow manure, which they used ordinarily for their fuel. And we did side-by-side tests, and here you can see\nthe charcoal briquettes and here the cow dung. And you can see that it's a lot cleaner\nburning of a cooking fuel. And in fact, it heats the water\na lot more quickly. And so we were very happy, thus far. But one of the things that we found was when we did side-by-side\ncomparisons with wood charcoal, it didn't burn as long. And the briquettes crumbled a little bit and we lost energy as they fell apart\nas they were cooking. So we wanted to try to find a way\nto make a stronger briquette so that we could compete with\nwood charcoal in the markets in Haiti. "},{"time":"06:40","text":"So we went back to MIT, we took out the Instron machine and we figured out\nwhat sort of forces you needed in order to compress\na briquette to the level that you actually are getting\nimproved performance out of it? And at the same time that we had\nstudents in the lab looking at this, we also had community partners in Haiti\nworking to develop the process, to improve it and make it more accessible\nto people in the villages there. And after some time, we developed a low-cost press\nthat allows you to produce charcoal, which actually now burns not only -- actually, it burns longer,\ncleaner than wood charcoal. "},{"time":"07:22","text":"So now we're in a situation\nwhere we have a product, which is actually better than what\nyou can buy in Haiti in the marketplace, which is a very wonderful place to be. In Haiti alone, about 30 million trees\nare cut down every year. There's a possibility\nof this being implemented and saving a good portion of those. In addition, the revenue generated\nfrom that charcoal is 260 million dollars. That's an awful lot\nfor a country like Haiti -- with a population of eight million and an average income\nof less than 400 dollars. So this is where we're also moving ahead\nwith our charcoal project. "},{"time":"08:02","text":"And one of the things\nthat I think is also interesting, is I have a friend up at UC Berkeley\nwho's been doing risk analysis. And he's looked at the problem\nof the health impacts of burning wood versus charcoal. And he's found that worldwide,\nyou could prevent a million deaths switching from wood\nto charcoal as a cooking fuel. That's remarkable, but up until now, there weren't ways\nto do it without cutting down trees. But now we have a way that's using an agricultural\nwaste material to create a cooking fuel. "},{"time":"08:31","text":"One of the really exciting things, though, is something that came out of the trip\nthat I took to Ghana just last month. And I think it's the coolest thing, and it's even lower tech\nthan what you just saw, if you can imagine such a thing. Here it is. So what is this? This is corncobs turned into charcoal. And the beauty of this is\nthat you don't need to form briquettes -- it comes ready made. This is my $100 laptop, right here. And actually, like Nick,\nI brought samples. "},{"time":"09:01","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"09:03","text":"So we can pass these around. They're fully functional,\nfield-tested, ready to roll out. "},{"time":"09:11","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"09:15","text":"And I think one of the things which is also remarkable\nabout this technology, is that the technology\ntransfer is so easy. Compared to the sugarcane charcoal, where we have to teach people\nhow to form it into briquettes and you have the extra step\nof cooking the binder, this comes pre-briquetted. And this is about the most exciting\nthing in my life right now, which is perhaps\na sad commentary on my life. "},{"time":"09:39","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"09:41","text":"But once you see it,\nlike you guys in the front row -- All right, yeah, OK. So anyway -- "},{"time":"09:46","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"09:48","text":"Here it is. And this is, I think, a perfect example of what Robert Wright was talking about\nin those non-zero-sum things. So not only do you have health benefits, you have environmental benefits. But this is one\nof the incredibly rare situations where you also have economic benefits. People can make their own cooking fuel\nfrom waste products. They can generate income from this. They can save the money\nthat they were going to spend on charcoal and they can produce excess\nand sell it in the market to people who aren't making their own. It's really rare\nthat you don't have trade-offs between health and economics,\nor environment and economics. So this is a project\nthat I just find extremely exciting and I'm really looking forward\nto see where it takes us. "},{"time":"10:38","text":"So when we talk about, now,\nthe future we will create, one of the things\nthat I think is necessary is to have a very clear vision\nof the world that we live in. And now, I don't actually mean\nthe world that we live in. I mean the world where women\nspend two to three hours everyday grinding grain for their families to eat. I mean the world\nwhere advanced building materials means cement roofing tiles\nthat are made by hand, and where, when you work 10 hours a day, you're still only earning\n60 dollars in a month. I mean the world where women and children spend\n40 billion hours a year fetching water. That's as if the entire workforce\nof the state of California worked full time for a year\ndoing nothing but fetching water. "},{"time":"11:28","text":"It's a place where,\nfor example, if this were India, in this room, only three of us\nwould have a car. If this were Afghanistan, only one person in this room\nwould know how the use the Internet. If this were Zambia -- 300 of you would be farmers, 100 of you would have AIDS or HIV. And more than half of you would be living\non less than a dollar a day. These are the issues that we\nneed to come up with solutions for. These are the issues that\nwe need to be training our engineers, our designers, our business people,\nour entrepreneurs to be facing. These are the solutions\nthat we need to find. "},{"time":"12:10","text":"I have a few areas that I believe\nare especially important that we address. One of them is creating technologies to promote micro-finance\nand micro-enterprise, so that people who are living\nbelow the poverty line can find a way to move out -- and that they're not doing it using the same traditional\nbasket making, poultry rearing, etc. But there are new technologies\nand new products that they can make on a small scale. "},{"time":"12:35","text":"The next thing I believe is that we need to create\ntechnologies for poor farmers to add value to their own crops. And we need to rethink\nour development strategies, so that we're not promoting\neducational campaigns to get them to stop being farmers, but rather to stop being poor farmers. And we need to think\nabout how we can do that effectively. We need to work with the people\nin these communities and give them the resources\nand the tools that they need to solve their own problems. That's the best way to do it. We shouldn't be doing it from outside. So we need to create this future,\nand we need to start doing it now. "},{"time":"13:15","text":"Thank you.

One of the really exciting things\nis looking at solar water disinfection and improving the ability\nto be able to do that.

If we are to call the tyranny of assumptions into question, and avoid doxa, the realm of the unquestioned, then we must be willing to subject our own assumptions to debate and discussion. It is in this spirit that I join into a discussion of one of the critical issues of our time, namely, how to mobilize different forms of capital for the project of state building. "},{"time":"00:39","text":"To put the assumptions very clearly: capitalism, after 150 years, has become acceptable, and so has democracy. If we looked in the world of 1945 and looked at the map of capitalist economies and democratic polities, they were the rare exception, not the norm. The question now, however, is both about which form of capitalism and which type of democratic participation. But we must acknowledge that this moment has brought about a rare consensus of assumptions. And that provides the ground for a type of action, because consensus of each moment allows us to act. And it is necessary, no matter how fragile or how provisional our consensus, to be able to move forward. "},{"time":"01:38","text":"But the majority of the world neither benefits from capitalism nor from democratic systems. Most of the globe experiences the state as repressive, as an organization that is concerned about denial of rights, about denial of justice, rather than provision of it. And in terms of experience of capitalism, there are two aspects that the rest of the globe experiences. First, extractive industry. Blood diamonds, smuggled emeralds, timber, that is cut right from under the poorest. Second is technical assistance. And technical assistance might shock you, but it's the worst form of -- today -- of the ugly face of the developed world to the developing countries. Tens of billions of dollars are supposedly spent on building capacity with people who are paid up to 1,500 dollars a day, who are incapable of thinking creatively, or organically. "},{"time":"02:56","text":"Next assumption -- and of course the events of July 7, I express my deep sympathy, and before that, September 11 -- have reminded us we do not live in three different worlds. We live in one world. But that's easily said. But we are not dealing with the implications of the one world that we are living in. And that is that if we want to have one world, this one world cannot be based on huge pockets of exclusion, and then inclusion for some. We must now finally come to think about the premises of a truly global world, in relationship to the regime of rights and responsibilities and accountabilities that are truly global in scope. Otherwise we will be missing this open moment in history, where we have a consensus on both the form of politics and the form of economics. "},{"time":"03:57","text":"What is one of these organizations to pick? We have three critical terms: economy, civil society and the state. I will not deal with those first two, except to say that uncritical transfer of assumptions, from one context to another, can only make for disaster. Economics taught in most of the elite universities are practically useless in my context. My country is dominated by drug economy and a mafia. Textbook economics does not work in my context, and I have very few recommendations from anybody as to how to put together a legal economy. The poverty of our knowledge must become the first basis of moving forward, and not imposition of the framework that works on the basis of mathematical modeling, for which I have enormous respect. My colleagues at Johns Hopkins were among the best. "},{"time":"04:58","text":"Second, instead of debating endlessly about what is the structure of the state, why don't we simplify and say, what are a series of functions that the state in the 21st century must perform? Clare Lockhart and I are writing a book on this; we hope to share that much widely with -- and third is that we could actually construct an index to measure comparatively how well these functions that we would agree on are being performed in different places. "},{"time":"05:28","text":"So what are these functions? We propose 10. And it's legitimate monopoly of means of violence, administrative control, management of public finances, investment in human capital, provision of citizenship rights, provision of infrastructure, management of the tangible and intangible assets of the state through regulation, creation of the market, international agreements, including public borrowing, and then, most importantly, rule of law. "},{"time":"05:54","text":"I won't elaborate. I hope the questions will give me an opportunity. This is a feasible goal, basically because, contrary to widespread assumption, I would argue that we know how to do this. Who would have imagined that Germany would be either united or democratic today, if you looked at it from the perspective of Oxford of 1943? But people at Oxford prepared for a democratic Germany and engaged in planning. And there are lots of other examples. "},{"time":"06:27","text":"Now in order to do this -- and this brings this group -- we have to rethink the notion of capital. The least important form of capital, in this project, is financial capital -- money. Money is not capital in most of the developing countries. It's just cash. Because it lacks the institutional, organizational, managerial forms to turn it into capital. And what is required is a combination of physical capital, institutional capital, human capital -- and security, of course, is critical, but so is information. "},{"time":"07:07","text":"Now, the issue that should concern us here -- and that's the challenge that I would like to pose to this group -- is again, it takes 16 years in your countries to produce somebody with a B.S. degree. It takes 20 years to produce somebody with a Ph.D. The first challenge is to rethink, fundamentally, the issue of the time. Do we need to repeat the modalities that we have inherited? Our educational systems are inherited from the 19th century. What is it that we need to do fundamentally to re-engage in a project, that capital formation is rapid? The absolute majority of the world's population are below 20, and they are growing larger and faster. They need different ways of being approached, different ways of being enfranchised, different ways of being skilled. And that's the first thing. "},{"time":"08:18","text":"Second is, you're problem solvers, but you're not engaging your global responsibility. You've stayed away from the problems of corruption. You only want clean environments in which to function. But if you don't think through the problems of corruption, who will? You stay away from design for development. You're great designers, but your designs are selfish. It's for your own immediate use. The world in which I operate operates with designs regarding roads, or dams, or provision of electricity that have not been revisited in 60 years. This is not right. It requires thinking. "},{"time":"09:07","text":"But, particularly, what we need more than anything else from this group is your imagination to be brought to bear on problems the way a meme is supposed to work. As the work on paradigms, long time ago showed -- Thomas Kuhn's work -- it's in the intersection of ideas that new developments -- true breakthroughs -- occur. And I hope that this group would be able to deal with the issue of state and development and the empowerment of the majority of the world's poor, through this means. Thank you. (Applause) "},{"time":"09:50","text":"Chris Anderson: So, Ashraf, until recently, you were the finance minister of Afghanistan, a country right at the middle of much of the world's agenda.

(Laughter) You asked me. You know I always give the unconventional answer. No. But seriously, the issue of Afghanistan first has to be seen as, at least, a 10- to 20-year perspective. Today the world of globalization is on speed. Time has been compressed. And space does not exist for most people. But in my world -- you know, when I went back to Afghanistan after 23 years, space had expanded. Every conceivable form of infrastructure had broken down. I rode -- traveled -- travel between two cities that used to take three hours now took 12. So the first is when the scale is that, we need to recognize that just the simple things that are infrastructure -- it takes six years to deliver infrastructure. In our world. Any meaningful sort of thing. But the modality of attention, or what is happening today, what's happening tomorrow. "},{"time":"11:15","text":"Second is, when a country has been subjected to one of the most immense, brutal forms of exercise of power -- we had the Red Army for 10 continuous years, 110,000 strong, literally terrorizing. The sky: every Afghan sees the sky as a source of fear. We were bombed practically out of existence. Then, tens of thousands of people were trained in terrorism -- from all sides. The United States, Great Britain, joined for instance, Egyptian intelligence service to train thousands of people in resistance and urban terrorism. How to turn a bicycle into an instrument of terror. How to turn a donkey, a carthorse, anything. And the Russians, equally. So, when violence erupts in a country like Afghanistan, it's because of that legacy. But we have to understand that we've been incredibly lucky. I mean, I really can't believe how lucky I am here, standing in front of you, speaking. When I joined as finance minister, I thought that the chances of my living more than three years would not be more than five percent. Those were the risks. They were worth it. "},{"time":"12:46","text":"I think we can make it, and the reason we can make it is because of the people. You see, because, I mean -- I give you one statistic. 91 percent of the men in Afghanistan, 86 percent of the women, listen to at least three radio stations a day. In terms of their discourse, in terms of their sophistication of knowledge of the world, I think that I would dare say, they're much more sophisticated than rural Americans with college degrees and the bulk of Europeans -- because the world matters to them. And what is their predominant concern? Abandonment. Afghans have become deeply internationalist. "},{"time":"13:34","text":"You know, when I went back in December of 2001, I had absolutely no desire to work with the Afghan government because I'd lived as a nationalist. And I told them -- my people, with the Americans here -- separate. Yes, I have an advisory position with the U.N. I went through 10 Afghan provinces very rapidly. And everybody was telling me it was a different world. You know, they engage. They see engagement, global engagement, as absolutely necessary to the future of the ordinary people. And the thing that the ordinary Afghan is most concerned with is -- Clare Lockhart is here, so I'll recite a discussion she had with an illiterate woman in Northern Afghanistan. And that woman said she didn't care whether she had food on her table. What she worried about was whether there was a plan for the future, where her children could really have a different life. That gives me hope. CA: How is Afghanistan going to provide alternative income to the many people who are making their living off the drugs trade? "},{"time":"14:34","text":"AG: Certainly. Well, the first is, instead of sending a billion dollars on drug eradication and paying it to a couple of security companies, they should give this hundred billion dollars to 50 of the most critically innovative companies in the world to ask them to create one million jobs. The key to the drug eradication is jobs. Look, there's a very little known fact: countries that have a legal average income per capita of 1,000 dollars don't produce drugs. "},{"time":"15:07","text":"Second, textile. Trade is the key, not aid. The U.S. and Europe should give us a zero percent tariff. The textile industry is incredibly mobile. If you want us to be able to compete with China and to attract investment, we could probably attract four to six billion dollars quite easily in the textile sector, if there was zero tariffs -- would create the type of job. Cotton does not compete with opium; a t-shirt does. And we need to understand, it's the value chain. Look, the ordinary Afghan is sick and tired of hearing about microcredit. It is important, but what the ordinary women and men who engage in micro-production want is global access. They don't want to sell to the charity bazaars that are only for foreigners -- and the same bloody shirt embroidered time and again. What we want is a partnership with the Italian design firms. Yeah, we have the best embroiderers in the world! Why can't we do what was done with northern Italy? With the Put Out system? So I think economically, the critical issue really is to now think through. "},{"time":"16:29","text":"And what I will say here is that aid doesn't work. You know, the aid system is broken. The aid system does not have the knowledge, the vision, the ability. I'm all for it; after all, I raised a lot of it. Yeah, to be exact, you know, I managed to persuade the world that they had to give my country 27.5 billion. They didn't want to give us the money. "},{"time":"16:50","text":"CA: And it still didn't work? "},{"time":"16:52","text":"AG: No. It's not that it didn't work. It's that a dollar of private investment, in my judgment, is equal at least to 20 dollars of aid, in terms of the dynamic that it generates. Second is that one dollar of aid could be 10 cents; it could be 20 cents; or it could be four dollars. It depends on what form it comes, what degrees of conditionalities are attached to it. You know, the aid system, at first, was designed to benefit entrepreneurs of the developed countries, not to generate growth in the poor countries. And this is, again, one of those assumptions -- the way car seats are an assumption that we've inherited in governments, and doors. You would think that the US government would not think that American firms needed subsidizing to function in developing countries, provide advice, but they do. There's an entire weight of history vis-a-vis aid that now needs to be reexamined. If the goal is to build states that can credibly take care of themselves -- and I'm putting that proposition equally; you know I'm very harsh on my counterparts -- aid must end in each country in a definable period. And every year there must be progress on mobilization of domestic revenue and generation of the economy. Unless that kind of compact is entered into, you will not be able to sustain the consensus.

And that is, instinctively we've gone out and climbed over difficult places, went to more hostile places, and found out later, maybe to our surprise, that that's the reason we survived. And I feel very strongly that it's not good enough for us to have generations of kids that think that it's OK to look forward to a better version of a cell phone with a video in it.

That's the theme of my next 15 minutes here. And I think that the inspiration begins when you're very young:\n three-year-olds, up to 12-, 14-year-olds. What they look at is the most important thing. "},{"time":"02:33","text":"Let's take a snapshot at aviation. And there was a wonderful little short four-year time period when marvelous things happened. It started in 1908, when the Wright brothers flew in Paris, and everybody said, \"Ooh, hey, I can do that.\" There's only a few people that have flown in early 1908. In four years, 39 countries had hundreds of airplanes, thousand of pilots. Airplanes were invented by natural selection. Now you can say that intelligent design designs our airplanes of today, but there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanes. There were probably at least 30,000 different things tried, and when they crash and kill the pilot, don't try that again. The ones that flew and landed OK because there were no trained pilots who had good flying qualities by definition. So we, by making a whole bunch of attempts, thousands of attempts, in that four-year time period, we invented the concepts of the airplanes that we fly today. And that's why they're so safe, as we gave it a lot of chance to find what's good. That has not happened at all in space flying. There's only been two concepts tried -- two by the U.S. and one by the Russians. "},{"time":"03:45","text":"Well, who was inspired during that time period? Aviation Week asked me to make a list of who I thought were the movers and shakers of the first 100 years of aviation. And I wrote them down and I found out later that every one of them was a little kid in that wonderful renaissance of aviation. Well, what happened when I was a little kid was -- some pretty heavy stuff too. The jet age started: the missile age started. Von Braun was on there showing how to go to Mars -- and this was before Sputnik. And this was at a time when Mars was a hell of a lot more interesting than it is now. We thought there'd be animals there; we knew there were plants there; the colors change, right? But, you know, NASA screwed that up because they've sent these robots and they've landed it only in the deserts.

You notice here's a big jump when I was a little kid -- and I think that had something to do with giving me the courage to go out and try something that other people weren't having the courage to try. Well, what did I do when I was a kid? I didn't do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing and, well, we didn't have drugs in those days. But I did competition model airplanes. I spent about seven years during the Vietnam War flight-testing airplanes for the Air Force. And then I went in and I had a lot of fun building airplanes that people could build in their garages. And some 3,000 of those are flying. Of course, one of them is around the world Voyager. I founded another company in '82, which is my company now. And we have developed more than one new type of airplane every year since 1982. And there's a lot of them that I actually can't show you on this chart. "},{"time":"05:39","text":"The most impressive airplane ever, I believe, was designed only a dozen years after the first operational jet. Stayed in service till it was too rusty to fly, taken out of service. We retreated in '98 back to something that was developed in '56. What? The most impressive spaceship ever, I believe, was a Grumman Lunar Lander. It was a -- you know, it landed on the moon, take off of the moon, didn't need any maintenance guys -- that's kind of cool. We've lost that capability. We abandoned it in '72. This thing was designed three years after Gagarin first flew in space in 1961. Three years, and we can't do that now. Crazy.

The interesting thing -- by the way, the speed here, excuse me, higher-speed travel is the title of these innovation cycles. There is none here. These two new airplanes are the same speed as the DC8 that was done in 1958. Here's the biggie, and that is, you don't have innovation cycles if the government develops and the government uses it. You know, a good example, of course, is the DARPA net. Computers were used for artillery first, then IRS. But when we got it, now you have all the level of activity, all the benefit from it.

In 2004, there were only two flights: two Russian Soyuz flights to the international manned station.

The first industry will be a high volume, a lot of players. There's another one announced just last week. And it will be sub-orbital. And the reason it has to be sub-orbital is, there is not solutions for adequate safety to fly the public to orbit. The governments have been doing this -- three governments have been doing this for 45 years, and still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died. That's -- You don't want to run a business with that kind of a safety record. It'll be very high volume; we think 100,000 people will fly by 2020. I can't tell you when this will start, because I don't want my competition to know my schedule. But I think once it does, we will find solutions, and very quickly, you'll see those resort hotels in orbit. And that real easy thing to do, which is a swing around the moon so you have this cool view. And that will be really cool.

And the inventor is in this audience. Al Gore invented the Internet and because of that, something that we used for a whole year -- excuse me -- a whole decade for fun, became everything -- our commerce, our research, our communication and, if we let the Google guys think for another couple weekends, we can add a dozen more things to the list.

There's a group of people that have come forward -- and you don't know all of them -- but the ones that have come forward were inspired as young children, this little three- to 15-year-old age, by us going to orbit and going to the moon here, right in this time period. Paul Allen, Elan Musk, Richard Branson, Jeff Bezos, the Ansari family, which is now funding the Russians' sub-orbital thing, Bob Bigelow, a private space station, and Carmack. These people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area, and I think it's a lot better than they put it in an area of a better cell phone or something -- but they're putting it in very -- areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability, and it will lead us into the next really big thing and it will allow us to explore. And I think eventually it will allow us to colonize and to keep us from going extinct. "},{"time":"12:40","text":"They were inspired by big progress. But look at the progress that's going on after that. There were a couple of examples here. The military fighters had a -- highest-performance military airplane was the SR71. It went a whole life cycle, got too rusty to fly, and was taken out of service. The Concorde doubled the speed for airline travel. It went a whole life cycle without competition, took out of service. And we're stuck back here with the same kind of capability for military fighters and commercial airline travel that we had back in the late '50s. "},{"time":"13:15","text":"But something is out there to inspire our kids now. And I'm talking about if you've got a baby now, or if you've got a 10-year-old now. What's out there is there's something really interesting going to happen here. Relatively soon, you'll be able to buy a ticket and fly higher and faster than the highest-performance military operational airplane. It's never happened before. The fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance has been, well, you know, you win the war in 12 minutes; why do you need something better? But I think when you guys start buying tickets and flying sub-orbital flights to space, very soon -- wait a minute, what's happening here, we'll have military fighters with sub-orbital capability, and I think very soon this. But the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first. OK, I look forward to a new \"capitalist's space race,\" let's call it. "},{"time":"14:12","text":"You remember the space race in the '60s was for national prestige, because we lost the first two milestones. We didn't lose them technically. The fact that we had the hardware to put something in orbit when we let Von Braun fly it -- you can argue that's not a technical loss. Sputnik wasn't a technical loss, but it was a prestige loss. America -- the world saw America as not being the leader in technology, and that was a very strong thing. And then we flew Alan Shepherd weeks after Gagarin, not months or decades, or whatever. So we had the capability. But America lost. We lost. And because of that, we made a big jump to recover it. "},{"time":"15:02","text":"Well, again, what's interesting here is we've lost to the Russians on the first couple of milestones already. You cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in America -- can't do it. You can buy it in Russia. You can fly with Russian hardware. This is available because a Russian space program is starving, and it's nice for them to get 20 million here and there to take one of the seats. It's commercial. It can be defined as space tourism. They are also offering a trip to go on this whip around the moon, like Apollo 8 was done. 100 million bucks -- hey, I can go to the moon. But, you know, would you have thought back in the '60s, when the space race was going on, that the first commercial capitalist-like thing to do to buy a ticket to go to the moon would be in Russian hardware? And would you have thought, would the Russians have thought, that when they first go to the moon in their developed hardware, the guys inside won't be Russians? Maybe it'll probably be a Japanese or an American billionaire? Well, that's weird: you know, it really is. But anyway, I think we need to beat them again. "},{"time":"16:17","text":"I think what we'll do is we'll see a successful, very successful, private space flight industry. Whether we're first or not really doesn't matter. The Russians actually flew a supersonic transport before the Concorde. And then they flew a few cargo flights, and took it out of service. I think you kind of see the same kind of parallel when the commercial stuff is offered. "},{"time":"16:46","text":"OK, we'll talk just a little bit about commercial development for human space flight. This little thing says here: five times what NASA's doing by 2020. I want to tell you, already there's about 1.5 billion to 1.7 billion investment in private space flight that is not government at all -- already, worldwide. If you read -- if you Google it, you'll find about half of that money, but there's twice of that being committed out there -- not spent yet, but being committed and planned for the next few years. Hey, that's pretty big. I'm predicting, though, as profitable as this industry is going to be -- and it certainly is profitable when you fly people at 200,000 dollars on something that you can actually operate at a tenth of that cost, or less -- this is going to be very profitable. I predict, also, that the investment that will flow into this will be somewhere around half of what the U.S. taxpayer spends for NASA's manned spacecraft work. And every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently by a factor of 10 to 15. And what that means is before we know it, the progress in human space flight, with no taxpayer dollars, will be at a level of about five times as much as the current NASA budgets for human space flight. And that is because it's us. It's private industry. You should never depend on the government to do this sort of stuff -- and we've done it for a long time. The NACA, before NASA, never developed an airliner and never ran an airline. But NASA is developing the space liner, always has, and runs the only space line, OK. And we've shied away from it because we're afraid of it. But starting back in June of 2004, when I showed that a little group out there actually can do it, can get a start with it, everything changed after that time.

As chief of design for the BMW Group, Chris Bangle has overseen cars that have been seen the world over, including BMW 7 Series and the Z4 roadster."},"transcript":[{"time":"00:01","text":"What I want to talk about is, as background, is the idea that cars are art. This is actually quite meaningful to me, because car designers tend to be a little bit low on the totem pole -- we don't do coffee table books with just one lamp inside of it -- and cars are thought so much as a product that it's a little bit difficult to get into the aesthetic side under the same sort of terminology that one would discuss art. And so cars, as art, brings it into an emotional plane -- if you accept that -- that you have to deal with on the same level you would with art with a capital A. "},{"time":"00:34","text":"Now at this point you're going to see a picture of Michelangelo. This is completely different than automobiles. Automobiles are self-moving things, right? Elevators are automobiles. And they're not very emotional; they solve a purpose; and certainly automobiles have been around for 100 years and have made our lives functionally a lot better in many ways; they've also been a real pain in the ass, because automobiles are really the thing we have to solve. We have to solve the pollution, we have to solve the congestion -- but that's not what interests me in this speech. "},{"time":"01:07","text":"What interests me in this speech is cars. Automobiles may be what you use, but cars are what we are, in many ways. And as long as we can solve the problems of automobiles, and I believe we can, with fuel cells or hydrogen, like BMW is really hip on, and lots of other things, then I think we can look past that and try and understand why this hook is in many of us -- of this car-y-ness -- and what that means, what we can learn from it. That's what I want to get to. Cars are not a suit of clothes; cars are an avatar. Cars are an expansion of yourself: they take your thoughts, your ideas, your emotions, and they multiply it -- your anger, whatever. It's an avatar. It's a super-waldo that you happen to be inside of, and if you feel sexy, the car is sexy. And if you're full of road rage, you've got a \"Chevy: Like a Rock,\" right? "},{"time":"01:56","text":"Cars are a sculpture -- did you know this? That every car you see out there is sculpted by hand. Many people think, \"Well, it's computers, and it's done by machines and stuff like that.\" Well, they reproduce it, but the originals are all done by hand. It's done by men and women who believe a lot in their craft. And they put that same kind of tension into the sculpting of a car that you do in a great sculpture that you would go and look at in a museum. That tension between the need to express, the need to discover, then you put something new into it, and at the same time you have bounds of craftsmanship. Rules that say, this is how you handle surfaces; this is what control is all about; this is how you show you're a master of your craft. And that tension, that discovery, that push for something new -- and at the same time, that sense of obligation to the regards of craftsmanship -- that's as strong in cars as it is in anything. We work in clay, which hasn't changed much since Michelangelo started screwing around with it, and there's a very interesting analogy to that too. Real quickly -- Michelangelo once said he's there to \"discover the figure within,\" OK? There we go, the automobile. That was 100 years right there -- did you catch that? Between that one there, and that one there, it changed a lot didn't it? OK, it's not marketing; there's a very interesting car concept here, but the marketing part is not what I want to talk about here. I want to talk about this. Why it means you have to wash a car, what is it, that sensuality you have to touch about it? That's the sculpture that goes into it. That sensuality. And it's done by men and women working just like this, making cars. "},{"time":"03:26","text":"Now this little quote about sculpture from Henry Moore, I believe that that \"pressure within\" that Moore's talking about -- at least when it comes to cars -- comes right back to this idea of the mean. It's that will to live, that need to survive, to express itself, that comes in a car, and takes over people like me. And we tell other people, \"Do this, do this, do this,\" until this thing comes alive. We are completely infected. And beauty can be the result of this infectiousness; it's quite wonderful. This sculpture is, of course, at the heart of all of it, and it's really what puts the craftsmanship into our cars. And it's not a whole lot different, really, when they're working like this, or when somebody works like this. It's that same kind of commitment, that same kind of beauty. "},{"time":"04:06","text":"Now, now I get to the point. I want to talk about cars as art. Art, in the Platonic sense, is truth; it's beauty, and love. Now this is really where designers in car business diverge from the engineers. We don't really have a problem talking about love. We don't have a problem talking about truth or beauty in that sense. That's what we're searching for -- when we're working our craft, we are really trying to find that truth out there. We're not trying to find vanity and beauty. We're trying to find the beauty in the truth. However, engineers tend to look at things a little bit more Newtonian, instead of this quantum approach. We're dealing with irrationalisms, and we're dealing with paradoxes that we admit exist, and the engineers tend to look things a little bit more like two and two is four, and if you get 4.0 it's better, and 4.000 is even better. And that sometimes leads to bit of a divergence in why we're doing what we're doing. We've pretty much accepted the fact, though, that we are the women in the organization at BMW -- BMW is a very manly type business, -- men, men, men; it's engineers. And we're kind of the female side to that. That's OK, that's cool. You go off and be manly. We're going to be a little bit more female. Because what we're interested in is finding form that's more than just a function. "},{"time":"05:14","text":"We're interested in finding beauty that's more than just an aesthetic; it's really a truth. And I think this idea of soul, as being at the heart of great cars, is very applicable. You all know it. You know a car when you've seen it, with soul. You know how strong this is. Well, this experience of love, and the experience of design, to me, are interchangeable. And now I'm coming to my story. "},{"time":"05:34","text":"I discovered something about love and design through a project called Deep Blue. And first of all, you have to go with me for a second, and say, you know, you could take the word \"love\" out of a lot of things in our society, put the word \"design\" in, and it still works, like this quote here, you know. It kind of works, you know? You can understand that. It works in truisms. \"All is fair in design and war.\" Certainly we live in a competitive society. I think this one here, there's a pop song that really describes Philippe Starck for me, you know, this is like you know, this is like puppy love, you know, this is cool right? Toothbrush, cool. It really only gets serious when you look at something like this. OK? "},{"time":"06:12","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"06:14","text":"This is one substitution that I believe all of us, in design management, are guilty of. And this idea that there is more to love, more to design, when it gets down to your neighbor, your other, it can be physical like this, and maybe in the future it will be. But right now it's in dealing with our own people, our own teams who are doing the creating. So, to my story. The idea of people-work is what we work with here, and I have to make a bond with my designers when we're creating BMWs. We have to have a shared intimacy, a shared vision -- that means we have to work as one family; we have to understand ourselves that way. There's good times; there's interesting times; and there's some stress times too. You want to do cars, you've got to go outside. You've got to do cars in the rain; you've got to do cars in the snow. That's, by the way, is a presentation we made to our board of directors. We haul their butts out in the snow, too. You want to know cars outside? Well, you've got to stand outside to do this. And because these are artists, they have very artistic temperaments. All right? Now one thing about art is, art is discovery, and art is discovering yourself through your art. Right? And one thing about cars is we're all a little bit like Pygmalion, we are completely in love with our own creations. This is one of my favorite paintings, it really describes our relationship with cars. This is sick beyond belief. "},{"time":"07:37","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"07:39","text":"But because of this, the intimacy with which we work together as a team takes on a new dimension, a new meaning. We have a shared center; we have a shared focus -- that car stays at the middle of all our relationships. And it's my job, in the competitive process, to narrow this down. I heard today about Joseph's death genes that have to go in and kill cell reproduction. You know, that's what I have to do sometimes. We start out with 10 cars; we narrow it down to five cars, down to three cars, down to two cars, down to one car, and I'm in the middle of that killing, basically. Someone's love, someone's baby. This is very difficult, and you have to have a bond with your team that permits you to do this, because their life is wrapped up in that too. They've got that gene infected in them as well, and they want that to live, more than anything else. "},{"time":"08:35","text":"Well, this project, Deep Blue, put me in contact with my team in a way that I never expected, and I want to pass it on to you, because I want you to reflect on this, perhaps in your own relationships. We wanted to a do a car which was a complete leap of faith for BMW. We wanted to do a team which was so removed from the way we'd done it, that I only had a phone number that connected me to them. So, what we did was: instead of having a staff of artists that are just your wrist, we decided to free up a team of creative designers and engineers to find out what's the successor to the SUV phenomenon in America. This is 1996 we did this project. And so we sent them off with this team name, Deep Blue. Now many people know Deep Blue from IBM -- we actually stole it from them because we figured if anybody read our faxes they'd think we're talking about computers. It turned out it was quite clever because Deep Blue, in a company like BMW, has a hook -- \"Deep Blue,\" wow, cool name. So people get wrapped up in it. And we took a team of designers, and we sent them off to America. And we gave them a budget, what we thought was a set of deliverables, a timetable, and nothing else. Like I said, I just had a phone number that connected me to them. "},{"time":"09:39","text":"And a group of engineers worked in Germany, and the idea was they would work separately on this problem of what's the successor to the SUV. They would come together, compare notes. Then they would work apart, come together, and they would produce together a monumental set of diverse opinions that didn't pollute each other's ideas -- but at the same time came together and resolved the problems. Hopefully, really understand the customer at its heart, where the customer is, live with them in America. So -- sent the team off, and actually something different happened. They went other places. "},{"time":"10:12","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"10:15","text":"They disappeared, quite honestly, and all I got was postcards. Now, I got some postcards of these guys in Las Vegas, and I got some postcards of these guys in the Grand Canyon, and I got these postcards of Niagara Falls, and pretty soon they're in New York, and I don't know where else. And I'm telling myself, \"This is going to be a great car, they're doing research that I've never even thought about before.\" Right? And they decided that instead of, like, having a studio, and six or seven apartments, it was cheaper to rent Elizabeth Taylor's ex-house in Malibu. And -- at least they told me it was her house, I guess it was at one time, she had a party there or something. But anyway, this was the house, and they all lived there. Now this is 24/7 living, half-a-dozen people who'd left their -- some had left their wives behind and families behind, and they literally lived in this house for the entire six months the project was in America, but the first three months were the most intensive. And one of the young women in the project, she was a fantastic lady, she actually built her room in the bathroom. The bathroom was so big, she built the bed over the bathtub -- it's quite fascinating. "},{"time":"11:33","text":"On the other hand, I didn't know anything about this. OK? Nothing. This is all going on, and all I'm getting is postcards of these guys in Las Vegas, or whatever, saying, \"Don't worry Chris, this is really going to be good.\" OK? So my concept of what a design studio was probably -- I wasn't up to speed on where these guys were. "},{"time":"11:51","text":"However, the engineers back in Munich had taken on this kind of Newtonian solution, and they were trying to find how many cup holders can dance on the head of a pin, and, you know, these really serious questions that are confronting the modern consumer. And one was hoping that these two teams would get together, and this collusion of incredible creativity, under these incredible surroundings, and these incredibly stressed-out engineers, would create some incredible solutions. Well, what I didn't know was, and what we found out was -- these guys, they can't even like talk to each other under those conditions. You get a divergence of Newtonian and quantum thinking at that point, you have a split in your dialog that is so deep, and so far, that they cannot bring this together at all. "},{"time":"12:42","text":"And so we had our first meeting, after three months, in Tiburon, which is just up the road from here -- you know Tiburon? And the idea was after the first three months of this independent research they would present it all to Dr. Goschel -- who is now my boss, and at that time he was co-mentor on the project -- and they would present their results. We would see where we were going, we would see the first indication of what could be the successive phenomenon to the SUV in America. And so I had these ideas in my head, that this is going to be great. I mean, I'm going to see so much work, it's so intense -- I know probably Las Vegas meant a lot about it, and I'm not really sure where the Grand Canyon came in either -- but somehow all this is going to come together, and I'm going to see some really great product. So we went to Tiburon, after three months, and the team had gotten together the week before, many days ahead of time. The engineers flew over, and designers got together with them, and they put their presentation together. "},{"time":"13:37","text":"Well, it turns out that the engineers hadn't done anything. And they hadn't done anything because -- kind of, like in car business, engineers are there to solve problems, and we were asking them to create a problem. And the engineers were waiting for the designers to say, \"This is the problem that we've created, now help us solve it.\" And they couldn't talk about it. So what happened was, the engineers showed up with nothing. And the engineers told the designers, \"If you go in with all your stuff, we'll walk out, we'll walk right out of the project.\" "},{"time":"14:17","text":"So I didn't know any of this, and we got a presentation that had an agenda, looked like this. There was a whole lot of dialog. We spent four hours being told all about vocabulary that needs to be built between engineers and designers. And here I'm expecting at any moment, \"OK, they're going to turn the page, and I'm going to see the cars, I'm going to see the sketches, I'm going to see maybe some idea of where it's going.\" Dialog kept on going, with mental maps of words, and pretty soon it was becoming obvious that instead of being dazzled with brilliance, I was seriously being baffled with bullshit. And if you can imagine what this is like, to have these months of postcard indication of how great this team is working, and they're out there spending all this money, and they're learning, and they're doing all this stuff. I went fucking ballistic, right? I went nuts. You can probably remember Tiburon, it used to look like this. "},{"time":"15:13","text":"After four hours of this, I stood up, and I took this team apart. I screamed at them, I yelled at them, \"What the hell are you doing? You're letting me down, you're my designers, you're supposed to be the creative ones, what the hell is going on around here?\" It was probably one of my better tirades, I have some good ones, but this was probably one of my better ones. And I went into these people; how could they take BMW's money, how could they have a holiday for three months and produce nothing, nothing? Because of course they didn't tell us that they had three station wagons full of drawings, model concepts, pictures -- everything I wanted, they'd locked up in the cars, because they had shown solidarity with the engineers -- and they'd decided not to show me anything, in order to give the chance for problem solving a chance to start, because they hadn't realized, of course, that they couldn't do problem creating. So we went to lunch -- "},{"time":"16:11","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"16:16","text":"And I've got to tell you, this was one seriously quiet lunch. The engineers all sat at one end of the table, the designers and I sat at the other end of the table, really quiet. And I was just fucking furious, furious. OK? Probably because they had all the fun and I didn't, you know. That's what you get furious about right? And somebody asked me about Catherine, my wife, you know, did she fly out with me or something? I said, \"No,\" and it triggered a set of thoughts about my wife. And I recalled that when Catherine and I were married, the priest gave a very nice sermon, and he said something very important. He said, \"Love is not selfish,\" he said, \"Love does not mean counting how many times I say, 'I love you.' It doesn't mean you had sex this many times this month, and it's two times less than last month, so that means you don't love me as much. Love is not selfish.\" And I thought about this, and I thought, \"You know, I'm not showing love here. I'm seriously not showing love. I'm in the air, I'm in the air without trust. This cannot be. This cannot be that I'm expecting a certain number of sketches, and to me that's my quantification method for qualifying a team. This cannot be.\" "},{"time":"17:35","text":"So I told them this story. I said, \"Guys, I'm thinking about something here, this isn't right. I can't have a relationship with you guys based on a premise that is a quantifiable one. Based on a dictate premise that says, 'I'm a boss, you do what I say, without trust.'\" I said \"This can't be.\" Actually, we all broke down into tears, to be quite honest about it, because they still could not tell me how much frustration they had built up inside of them, not being able to show me what I wanted, and merely having to ask me to trust them that it would come. And I think we felt much closer that day, we cut a lot of strings that didn't need to be there, and we forged the concept for what real team and creativity is all about. We put the car back at the center of our thoughts, and we put love, I think, truly back into the center of the process. "},{"time":"18:34","text":"By the way, that team went on to create six different concepts for the next model of what would be the proposal for the next generation after SUVs in America. One of those was the idea of a crossover coupes -- you see it downstairs, the X Coupe -- they had a lot of fun with that. It was the rendition of our motorcycle, the GS, as Carl Magnusson says, \"brute-iful,\" as the idea of what could be a motorcycle, if you add two more wheels. And so, in conclusion, my lesson that I wanted to pass on to you, was this one here. I'm also going to steal a little quote out of \"Little Prince.\" There's a lot to be said about trust and love, if you know that those two words are synonymous for design. I had a very, very meaningful relationship with my team that day, and it's stayed that way ever since. And I hope that you too find that there's more to design, and more towards the art of the design, than doing it yourself. It's true that the trust and the love, that makes it worthwhile.

(Laughter) "},{"time":"00:16","text":"What I'm going to tell you about in my 18 minutes is how we're about to switch from reading the genetic code to the first stages of beginning to write the code ourselves. It's only 10 years ago this month when we published the first sequence of a free-living organism, that of haemophilus influenzae. That took a genome project from 13 years down to four months. We can now do that same genome project in the order of two to eight hours. So in the last decade, a large number of genomes have been added: most human pathogens, a couple of plants, several insects and several mammals, including the human genome. Genomics at this stage of the thinking from a little over 10 years ago was, by the end of this year, we might have between three and five genomes sequenced; it's on the order of several hundred. We just got a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation to sequence 130 genomes this year, as a side project from environmental organisms. So the rate of reading the genetic code has changed. "},{"time":"01:29","text":"But as we look, what's out there, we've barely scratched the surface on what is available on this planet. Most people don't realize it, because they're invisible, but microbes make up about a half of the Earth's biomass, whereas all animals only make up about one one-thousandth of all the biomass. And maybe it's something that people in Oxford don't do very often, but if you ever make it to the sea, and you swallow a mouthful of seawater, keep in mind that each milliliter has about a million bacteria and on the order of 10 million viruses. "},{"time":"02:04","text":"Less than 5,000 microbial species have been characterized as of two years ago, and so we decided to do something about it. And we started the Sorcerer II Expedition, where we were, as with great oceanographic expeditions, trying to sample the ocean every 200 miles. We started in Bermuda for our test project, then moved up to Halifax, working down the U.S. East Coast, the Caribbean Sea, the Panama Canal, through to the Galapagos, then across the Pacific, and we're in the process now of working our way across the Indian Ocean. It's very tough duty; we're doing this on a sailing vessel, in part to help excite young people about going into science. The experiments are incredibly simple. We just take seawater and we filter it, and we collect different size organisms on different filters, and then take their DNA back to our lab in Rockville, where we can sequence a hundred million letters of the genetic code every 24 hours. And with doing this, we've made some amazing discoveries. "},{"time":"03:08","text":"For example, it was thought that the visual pigments that are in our eyes -- there was only one or two organisms in the environment that had these same pigments. It turns out, almost every species in the upper parts of the ocean in warm parts of the world have these same photoreceptors, and use sunlight as the source of their energy and communication. From one site, from one barrel of seawater, we discovered 1.3 million new genes and as many as 50,000 new species. "},{"time":"03:40","text":"We've extended this to the air now with a grant from the Sloan Foundation. We're measuring how many viruses and bacteria all of us are breathing in and out every day, particularly on airplanes or closed auditoriums. (Laughter) We filter through some simple apparatuses; we collect on the order of a billion microbes from just a day filtering on top of a building in New York City. And we're in the process of sequencing all that at the present time. "},{"time":"04:10","text":"Just on the data collection side, just where we are through the Galapagos, we're finding that almost every 200 miles, we see tremendous diversity in the samples in the ocean. Some of these make logical sense, in terms of different temperature gradients. So this is a satellite photograph based on temperatures -- red being warm, blue being cold -- and we found there's a tremendous difference between the warm water samples and the cold water samples, in terms of abundant species. The other thing that surprised us quite a bit is these photoreceptors detect different wavelengths of light, and we can predict that based on their amino acid sequence. And these vary tremendously from region to region. Maybe not surprisingly, in the deep ocean, where it's mostly blue, the photoreceptors tend to see blue light. When there's a lot of chlorophyll around, they see a lot of green light. But they vary even more, possibly moving towards infrared and ultraviolet in the extremes. "},{"time":"05:15","text":"Just to try and get an assessment of what our gene repertoire was, we assembled all the data -- including all of ours thus far from the expedition, which represents more than half of all the gene data on the planet -- and it totaled around 29 million genes. And we tried to put these into gene families to see what these discoveries are: Are we just discovering new members of known families, or are we discovering new families? And it turns out we have about 50,000 major gene families, but every new sample we take in the environment adds in a linear fashion to these new families. So we're at the earliest stages of discovery about basic genes, components and life on this planet. "},{"time":"06:00","text":"When we look at the so-called evolutionary tree, we're up on the upper right-hand corner with the animals. Of those roughly 29 million genes, we only have around 24,000 in our genome. And if you take all animals together, we probably share less than 30,000 and probably maybe a dozen or more thousand different gene families. I view that these genes are now not only the design components of evolution. And we think in a gene-centric view -- maybe going back to Richard Dawkins' ideas -- than in a genome-centric view, which are different constructs of these gene components. "},{"time":"06:44","text":"Synthetic DNA, the ability to synthesize DNA, has changed at sort of the same pace that DNA sequencing has over the last decade or two, and is getting very rapid and very cheap. Our first thought about synthetic genomics came when we sequenced the second genome back in 1995, and that from mycoplasma genitalium. And we have really nice T-shirts that say, you know, \"I heart my genitalium.\" This is actually just a microorganism. But it has roughly 500 genes. Haemophilus had 1,800 genes. And we simply asked the question, if one species needs 800, another 500, is there a smaller set of genes that might comprise a minimal operating system? "},{"time":"07:29","text":"So we started doing transposon mutagenesis. Transposons are just small pieces of DNA that randomly insert in the genetic code. And if they insert in the middle of the gene, they disrupt its function. So we made a map of all the genes that could take transposon insertions and we called those \"non-essential genes.\" But it turns out the environment is very critical for this, and you can only define an essential or non-essential gene based on exactly what's in the environment. We also tried to take a more directly intellectual approach with the genomes of 13 related organisms, and we tried to compare all of those, to see what they had in common. And we got these overlapping circles. And we found only 173 genes common to all 13 organisms. The pool expanded a little bit if we ignored one intracellular parasite; it expanded even more when we looked at core sets of genes of around 310 or so. So we think that we can expand or contract genomes, depending on your point of view here, to maybe 300 to 400 genes from the minimal of 500. "},{"time":"08:38","text":"The only way to prove these ideas was to construct an artificial chromosome with those genes in them, and we had to do this in a cassette-based fashion. We found that synthesizing accurate DNA in large pieces was extremely difficult. Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison, my colleagues on this, developed an exciting new method that allowed us to synthesize a 5,000-base pair virus in only a two-week period that was 100 percent accurate, in terms of its sequence and its biology. It was a quite exciting experiment -- when we just took the synthetic piece of DNA, injected it in the bacteria and all of a sudden, that DNA started driving the production of the virus particles that turned around and then killed the bacteria. This was not the first synthetic virus -- a polio virus had been made a year before -- but it was only one ten-thousandth as active and it took three years to do. This is a cartoon of the structure of phi X 174. This is a case where the software now builds its own hardware, and that's the notions that we have with biology. "},{"time":"09:45","text":"People immediately jump to concerns about biological warfare, and I had recent testimony before a Senate committee, and a special committee the U.S. government has set up to review this area. And I think it's important to keep reality in mind, versus what happens with people's imaginations. Basically, any virus that's been sequenced today -- that genome can be made. And people immediately freak out about things about Ebola or smallpox, but the DNA from this organism is not infective. So even if somebody made the smallpox genome, that DNA itself would not cause infections. The real concern that security departments have is designer viruses. And there's only two countries, the U.S. and the former Soviet Union, that had major efforts on trying to create biological warfare agents. If that research is truly discontinued, there should be very little activity on the know-how to make designer viruses in the future. "},{"time":"10:47","text":"I think single-cell organisms are possible within two years. And possibly eukaryotic cells, those that we have, are possible within a decade. So we're now making several dozen different constructs, because we can vary the cassettes and the genes that go into this artificial chromosome. The key is, how do you put all of the others? We start with these fragments, and then we have a homologous recombination system that reassembles those into a chromosome. "},{"time":"11:19","text":"This is derived from an organism, deinococcus radiodurans, that can take three million rads of radiation and not be killed. It reassembles its genome after this radiation burst in about 12 to 24 hours, after its chromosomes are literally blown apart. This organism is ubiquitous on the planet, and exists perhaps now in outer space due to all our travel there. This is a glass beaker after about half a million rads of radiation. The glass started to burn and crack, while the microbes sitting in the bottom just got happier and happier. Here's an actual picture of what happens: the top of this shows the genome after 1.7 million rads of radiation. The chromosome is literally blown apart. And here's that same DNA automatically reassembled 24 hours later. It's truly stunning that these organisms can do that, and we probably have thousands, if not tens of thousands, of different species on this planet that are capable of doing that. After these genomes are synthesized, the first step is just transplanting them into a cell without a genome. "},{"time":"12:28","text":"So we think synthetic cells are going to have tremendous potential, not only for understanding the basis of biology but for hopefully environmental and society issues. For example, from the third organism we sequenced, Methanococcus jannaschii -- it lives in boiling water temperatures; its energy source is hydrogen and all its carbon comes from CO2 it captures back from the environment. So we know lots of different pathways, thousands of different organisms now that live off of CO2, and can capture that back. So instead of using carbon from oil for synthetic processes, we have the chance of using carbon and capturing it back from the atmosphere, converting that into biopolymers or other products. We have one organism that lives off of carbon monoxide, and we use as a reducing power to split water to produce hydrogen and oxygen. Also, there's numerous pathways that can be engineered metabolizing methane. And DuPont has a major program with Statoil in Norway to capture and convert the methane from the gas fields there into useful products. "},{"time":"13:41","text":"Within a short while, I think there's going to be a new field called \"Combinatorial Genomics,\" because with these new synthesis capabilities, these vast gene array repertoires and the homologous recombination, we think we can design a robot to make maybe a million different chromosomes a day. And therefore, as with all biology, you get selection through screening, whether you're screening for hydrogen production, or chemical production, or just viability. To understand the role of these genes is going to be well within reach. "},{"time":"14:13","text":"We're trying to modify photosynthesis to produce hydrogen directly from sunlight. Photosynthesis is modulated by oxygen, and we have an oxygen-insensitive hydrogenase that we think will totally change this process. We're also combining cellulases, the enzymes that break down complex sugars into simple sugars and fermentation in the same cell for producing ethanol. Pharmaceutical production is already under way in major laboratories using microbes. The chemistry from compounds in the environment is orders of magnitude more complex than our best chemists can produce. I think future engineered species could be the source of food, hopefully a source of energy, environmental remediation and perhaps replacing the petrochemical industry. "},{"time":"15:08","text":"Let me just close with ethical and policy studies. We delayed the start of our experiments in 1999 until we completed a year-and-a-half bioethical review as to whether we should try and make an artificial species. Every major religion participated in this. It was actually a very strange study, because the various religious leaders were using their scriptures as law books, and they couldn't find anything in them prohibiting making life, so it must be OK. The only ultimate concerns were biological warfare aspects of this, but gave us the go ahead to start these experiments for the reasons we were doing them. "},{"time":"15:48","text":"Right now the Sloan Foundation has just funded a multi-institutional study on this, to work out what the risk and benefits to society are, and the rules that scientific teams such as my own should be using in this area, and we're trying to set good examples as we go forward. These are complex issues. Except for the threat of bio-terrorism, they're very simple issues in terms of, can we design things to produce clean energy, perhaps revolutionizing what developing countries can do and provide through various simple processes. Thank you very much. "}]}]}
