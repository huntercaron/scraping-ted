I want to start with a couple of -- I'm going to show some new images, and I'm going to recapitulate\njust four or five. Now, the slide show. I update the slide show\nevery time I give it. I add new images, because I learn more about it\nevery time I give it. It's like beach-combing, you know? Every time the tide comes in and out,\nyou find some more shells. Just in the last two days, we got\nthe new temperature records in January. This is just for\nthe United States of America. Historical average\nfor Januarys is 31 degrees; last month was 39.5 degrees. "},{"time":"06:38","text":"Now, I know that you wanted some more\nbad news about the environment -- I'm kidding. But these are the recapitulation slides, and then I'm going to go into new\nmaterial about what you can do. But I wanted to elaborate\non a couple of these. First of all, this is where\nwe're projected to go with the U.S. contribution\nto global warming, under business as usual. Efficiency in end-use electricity\nand end-use of all energy is the low-hanging fruit. Efficiency and conservation --\nit's not a cost; it's a profit. The sign is wrong. It's not negative; it's positive. These are investments\nthat pay for themselves. But they are also very effective\nin deflecting our path. "},{"time":"07:25","text":"Cars and trucks -- I talked\nabout that in the slideshow, but I want you to put it in perspective. It's an easy, visible target of concern -- and it should be -- but there is more global warming pollution\nthat comes from buildings than from cars and trucks. Cars and trucks are very significant, and we have the lowest\nstandards in the world. And so we should address that.\nBut it's part of the puzzle. Other transportation efficiency\nis as important as cars and trucks. Renewables at the current levels\nof technological efficiency can make this much difference. And with what Vinod, and John Doerr\nand others, many of you here -- there are a lot of people\ndirectly involved in this -- this wedge is going to grow\nmuch more rapidly than the current projection shows it. Carbon Capture and Sequestration --\nthat's what CCS stands for -- is likely to become the killer app\nthat will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels\nin a way that is safe. Not quite there yet. OK. Now, what can you do? "},{"time":"08:46","text":"Reduce emissions in your home. Most of these expenditures\nare also profitable. Insulation, better design. Buy green electricity where you can. I mentioned automobiles -- buy a hybrid. Use light rail. Figure out some of the other options\nthat are much better. It's important. "},{"time":"09:10","text":"Be a green consumer. You have choices with everything you buy, between things that have a harsh effect, or a much less harsh effect\non the global climate crisis. Consider this: Make a decision to live\na carbon-neutral life. Those of you who are good at branding, I'd love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way\nthat connects with the most people. It is easier than you think. It really is. A lot of us in here\nhave made that decision, and it is really pretty easy. It means reduce\nyour carbon dioxide emissions with the full range\nof choices that you make, and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not\ncompletely reduced. And what it means is elaborated\nat climatecrisis.net. "},{"time":"10:15","text":"There is a carbon calculator. Participant Productions convened -- with my active involvement -- the leading software writers in the world, on this arcane science\nof carbon calculation, to construct a consumer-friendly\ncarbon calculator. You can very precisely calculate\nwhat your CO2 emissions are, and then you will be given\noptions to reduce. And by the time the movie\ncomes out in May, this will be updated to 2.0, and we will have click-through\npurchases of offsets. "},{"time":"10:55","text":"Next, consider making\nyour business carbon-neutral. Again, some of us have done that, and it's not as hard as you think. Integrate climate solutions\ninto all of your innovations, whether you are from the technology, or entertainment, or design\nand architecture community. Invest sustainably. Majora mentioned this. Listen, if you have invested money\nwith managers who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance, don't ever again complain\nabout quarterly report CEO management. Over time, people do\nwhat you pay them to do. And if they judge how much\nthey're going to get paid on your capital that they've invested, based on the short-term returns, you're going to get short-term decisions. A lot more to be said about that. "},{"time":"11:52","text":"Become a catalyst of change. Teach others, learn about it,\ntalk about it. The movie is a movie version\nof the slideshow I gave two nights ago,\nexcept it's a lot more entertaining. And it comes out in May. Many of you here have the opportunity\nto ensure that a lot of people see it. Consider sending somebody to Nashville. Pick well. And I am personally going to train people\nto give this slideshow -- re-purposed, with some\nof the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach, and it's not just the slides,\nit's what they mean. And it's how they link together. And so I'm going to be conducting\na course this summer for a group of people that are\nnominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse, in communities all across the country, and we're going to update the slideshow\nfor all of them every single week, to keep it right on the cutting edge. Working with Larry Lessig, it will be,\nsomewhere in that process, posted with tools\nand limited-use copyrights, so that young people can remix it\nand do it in their own way. "},{"time":"13:12","text":"(Applause) "},{"time":"13:15","text":"Where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay\narm's length from politics? It doesn't mean\nthat if you're a Republican, that I'm trying to convince you\nto be a Democrat. We need Republicans as well. This used to be a bipartisan issue, and I know that\nin this group it really is. Become politically active. Make our democracy work the way\nit's supposed to work. Support the idea of capping\ncarbon dioxide emissions -- global warming pollution --\nand trading it. Here's why: as long as the United States\nis out of the world system, it's not a closed system. Once it becomes a closed system,\nwith U.S. participation, then everybody\nwho's on a board of directors -- how many people here\nserve on the board of directors of a corporation? Once it's a closed system, you will have legal liability\nif you do not urge your CEO to get the maximum income from reducing\nand trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided. The market will work\nto solve this problem -- if we can accomplish this. Help with the mass persuasion campaign\nthat will start this spring. We have to change the minds\nof the American people. Because presently, the politicians\ndo not have permission to do what needs to be done. "},{"time":"14:33","text":"And in our modern country, the role\nof logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power\nthe way it once did. It's now repetition of short, hot-button,\n30-second, 28-second television ads. We have to buy a lot of those ads. Let's re-brand global warming,\nas many of you have suggested. I like \"climate crisis\"\ninstead of \"climate collapse,\" but again, those of you\nwho are good at branding, I need your help on this. Somebody said the test\nwe're facing now, a scientist told me, is whether the combination\nof an opposable thumb and a neocortex is a viable combination. "},{"time":"15:11","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"15:13","text":"That's really true. "},{"time":"15:18","text":"I said the other night,\nand I'll repeat now: this is not a political issue. Again, the Republicans here --\nthis shouldn't be partisan. You have more influence\nthan some of us who are Democrats do. This is an opportunity. Not just this, but connected\nto the ideas that are here, to bring more coherence to them. We are one. "},{"time":"15:44","text":"Thank you very much, I appreciate it.

I think it's one of the most exciting\nthat I'm working on, but I think it's also the simplest. "},{"time":"0:00","text":"It's a project that has the potential\nto make a huge impact around the world. It addresses one of the biggest\nhealth issues on the planet, the number one cause of death\nin children under five. Which is ...? Water-borne diseases?\nDiarrhea? Malnutrition? No. It's breathing the smoke\nfrom indoor cooking fires -- acute respiratory infections\ncaused by this. Can you believe that? "},{"time":"0:00","text":"I find this shocking\nand somewhat appalling. Can't we make\ncleaner burning cooking fuels? Can't we make better stoves? How is it that this can lead\nto over two million deaths every year? I know Bill Joy was talking to you\nabout the wonders of carbon nanotubes, so I'm going to talk to you\nabout the wonders of carbon macro-tubes, which is charcoal. "},{"time":"0:00","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"0:00","text":"So this is a picture of rural Haiti. Haiti is now 98 percent deforested. You'll see scenes like this\nall over the island. It leads to all sorts\nof environmental problems and problems that affect people\nthroughout the nation. A couple years ago\nthere was severe flooding that led to thousands of deaths -- that's directly attributable to the fact that there are no trees on the hills\nto stabilize the soil. So the rains come -- they go down the rivers\nand the flooding happens. "},{"time":"0:00","text":"Now one of the reasons\nwhy there are so few trees is this: people need to cook, and they harvest wood\nand they make charcoal in order to do it. It's not that people are ignorant\nto the environmental damage. They know perfectly well,\nbut they have no other choice. Fossil fuels are not available, and solar energy doesn't cook the way\nthat they like their food prepared. And so this is what they do. You'll find families like this who go out\ninto the forest to find a tree, cut it down and make charcoal out of it. So not surprisingly, there's a lot of effort that's been done\nto look at alternative cooking fuels. "},{"time":"0:00","text":"About four years ago, I took\na team of students down to Haiti and we worked with\nPeace Corps volunteers there. This is one such volunteer and this is a device that he had built\nin the village where he worked. And the idea was\nthat you could take waste paper; you could compress it and make briquettes\nthat could be used for fuel. But this device was very slow. So our engineering students\nwent to work on it and with some very simple changes, they were able to triple\nthe throughput of this device. So you could imagine\nthey were very excited about it. And they took the briquettes back to MIT\nso that they could test them. And one of the things\nthat they found was they didn't burn. So it was a little\ndiscouraging to the students. "},{"time":"0:00","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"0:00","text":"And in fact, if you look closely, right here you can see\nit says, \"US Peace Corps.\" As it turns out, there actually wasn't\nany waste paper in this village. And while it was a good use\nof government paperwork for this volunteer to bring it\nback with him to his village, it was 800 kilometers away. And so we thought perhaps\nthere might be a better way to come up with\nan alternative cooking fuel. "},{"time":"0:00","text":"What we wanted to do\nis we wanted to make a fuel that used something that was\nreadily available on the local level. You see these all over Haiti as well. They're small-scale sugar mills. And the waste product from them after you extract the juice\nfrom the sugarcane is called \"bagasse.\" It has no other use. It has no nutritional value,\nso they don't feed it to the animals. It just sits in a pile near the sugar mill\nuntil eventually they burn it. What we wanted to do was\nwe wanted to find a way to harness this waste resource\nand turn it into a fuel that would be something\nthat people could easily cook with, something like charcoal. So over the next couple of years, students and I worked\nto develop a process. "},{"time":"0:00","text":"So you start with the bagasse,\nand then you take a very simple kiln that you can make out of\na waste fifty five-gallon oil drum. After some time, after setting it on fire, you seal it to restrict the oxygen\nthat goes into the kiln, and then you end up\nwith this carbonized material here. However, you can't burn this. It's too fine and it burns too quickly\nto be useful for cooking. So we had to try to find a way\nto form it into useful briquettes. And conveniently,\none of my students was from Ghana, and he remembered a dish his mom\nused to make for him called \"kokonte,\" which is a very sticky porridge\nmade out of the cassava root. And so what we did was we looked, and we found that cassava\nis indeed grown in Haiti, under the name of \"manioc.\" In fact, it's grown all over the world -- yucca, tapioca, manioc, cassava,\nit's all the same thing -- a very starchy root vegetable. And you can make a very thick,\nsticky porridge out of it, which you can use to bind together\nthe charcoal briquettes. So we did this. We went down to Haiti. These are the graduates\nof the first Ecole de Charbon, or Charcoal Institute. And these -- "},{"time":"0:00","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"0:00","text":"That's right. So I'm actually\nan instructor at MIT as well as CIT. And these are the briquettes that we made. "},{"time":"0:00","text":"Now I'm going to take you\nto a different continent. This is India and this is the most commonly used\ncooking fuel in India. It's cow dung. And more than in Haiti,\nthis produces really smoky fires, and this is where you see\nthe health impacts of cooking with cow dung\nand biomass as a fuel. Kids and women\nare especially affected by it, because they're the ones\nwho are around the cooking fires. "},{"time":"0:00","text":"So we wanted to see if we could introduce\nthis charcoal-making technology there. Well, unfortunately,\nthey didn't have sugarcane and they didn't have cassava, but that didn't stop us. What we did was we found what were\nthe locally available sources of biomass. And there was wheat straw\nand there was rice straw in this area. And what we could use as a binder\nwas actually small amounts of cow manure, which they used ordinarily for their fuel. And we did side-by-side tests, and here you can see\nthe charcoal briquettes and here the cow dung. And you can see that it's a lot cleaner\nburning of a cooking fuel. And in fact, it heats the water\na lot more quickly. And so we were very happy, thus far. But one of the things that we found was when we did side-by-side\ncomparisons with wood charcoal, it didn't burn as long. And the briquettes crumbled a little bit and we lost energy as they fell apart\nas they were cooking. So we wanted to try to find a way\nto make a stronger briquette so that we could compete with\nwood charcoal in the markets in Haiti. "},{"time":"0:00","text":"So we went back to MIT, we took out the Instron machine and we figured out\nwhat sort of forces you needed in order to compress\na briquette to the level that you actually are getting\nimproved performance out of it? And at the same time that we had\nstudents in the lab looking at this, we also had community partners in Haiti\nworking to develop the process, to improve it and make it more accessible\nto people in the villages there. And after some time, we developed a low-cost press\nthat allows you to produce charcoal, which actually now burns not only -- actually, it burns longer,\ncleaner than wood charcoal. "},{"time":"0:00","text":"So now we're in a situation\nwhere we have a product, which is actually better than what\nyou can buy in Haiti in the marketplace, which is a very wonderful place to be. In Haiti alone, about 30 million trees\nare cut down every year. There's a possibility\nof this being implemented and saving a good portion of those. In addition, the revenue generated\nfrom that charcoal is 260 million dollars. That's an awful lot\nfor a country like Haiti -- with a population of eight million and an average income\nof less than 400 dollars. So this is where we're also moving ahead\nwith our charcoal project. "},{"time":"0:00","text":"And one of the things\nthat I think is also interesting, is I have a friend up at UC Berkeley\nwho's been doing risk analysis. And he's looked at the problem\nof the health impacts of burning wood versus charcoal. And he's found that worldwide,\nyou could prevent a million deaths switching from wood\nto charcoal as a cooking fuel. That's remarkable, but up until now, there weren't ways\nto do it without cutting down trees. But now we have a way that's using an agricultural\nwaste material to create a cooking fuel. "},{"time":"0:00","text":"One of the really exciting things, though, is something that came out of the trip\nthat I took to Ghana just last month. And I think it's the coolest thing, and it's even lower tech\nthan what you just saw, if you can imagine such a thing. Here it is. So what is this? This is corncobs turned into charcoal. And the beauty of this is\nthat you don't need to form briquettes -- it comes ready made. This is my $100 laptop, right here. And actually, like Nick,\nI brought samples. "},{"time":"0:00","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"0:00","text":"So we can pass these around. They're fully functional,\nfield-tested, ready to roll out. "},{"time":"0:00","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"0:00","text":"And I think one of the things which is also remarkable\nabout this technology, is that the technology\ntransfer is so easy. Compared to the sugarcane charcoal, where we have to teach people\nhow to form it into briquettes and you have the extra step\nof cooking the binder, this comes pre-briquetted. And this is about the most exciting\nthing in my life right now, which is perhaps\na sad commentary on my life. "},{"time":"0:00","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"0:00","text":"But once you see it,\nlike you guys in the front row -- All right, yeah, OK. So anyway -- "},{"time":"0:00","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"0:00","text":"Here it is. And this is, I think, a perfect example of what Robert Wright was talking about\nin those non-zero-sum things. So not only do you have health benefits, you have environmental benefits. But this is one\nof the incredibly rare situations where you also have economic benefits. People can make their own cooking fuel\nfrom waste products. They can generate income from this. They can save the money\nthat they were going to spend on charcoal and they can produce excess\nand sell it in the market to people who aren't making their own. It's really rare\nthat you don't have trade-offs between health and economics,\nor environment and economics. So this is a project\nthat I just find extremely exciting and I'm really looking forward\nto see where it takes us. "},{"time":"0:00","text":"So when we talk about, now,\nthe future we will create, one of the things\nthat I think is necessary is to have a very clear vision\nof the world that we live in. And now, I don't actually mean\nthe world that we live in. I mean the world where women\nspend two to three hours everyday grinding grain for their families to eat. I mean the world\nwhere advanced building materials means cement roofing tiles\nthat are made by hand, and where, when you work 10 hours a day, you're still only earning\n60 dollars in a month. I mean the world where women and children spend\n40 billion hours a year fetching water. That's as if the entire workforce\nof the state of California worked full time for a year\ndoing nothing but fetching water. "},{"time":"0:00","text":"It's a place where,\nfor example, if this were India, in this room, only three of us\nwould have a car. If this were Afghanistan, only one person in this room\nwould know how the use the Internet. If this were Zambia -- 300 of you would be farmers, 100 of you would have AIDS or HIV. And more than half of you would be living\non less than a dollar a day. These are the issues that we\nneed to come up with solutions for. These are the issues that\nwe need to be training our engineers, our designers, our business people,\nour entrepreneurs to be facing. These are the solutions\nthat we need to find. "},{"time":"0:00","text":"I have a few areas that I believe\nare especially important that we address. One of them is creating technologies to promote micro-finance\nand micro-enterprise, so that people who are living\nbelow the poverty line can find a way to move out -- and that they're not doing it using the same traditional\nbasket making, poultry rearing, etc. But there are new technologies\nand new products that they can make on a small scale. "},{"time":"0:00","text":"The next thing I believe is that we need to create\ntechnologies for poor farmers to add value to their own crops. And we need to rethink\nour development strategies, so that we're not promoting\neducational campaigns to get them to stop being farmers, but rather to stop being poor farmers. And we need to think\nabout how we can do that effectively. We need to work with the people\nin these communities and give them the resources\nand the tools that they need to solve their own problems. That's the best way to do it. We shouldn't be doing it from outside. So we need to create this future,\nand we need to start doing it now. "},{"time":"0:00","text":"Thank you. "},{"time":"0:00","text":"(Applause) "},{"time":"0:00","text":"Chris Anderson: Thank you, incredible. Stay here. Tell us -- just while we see\nif someone has a question -- just tell us about one of the other things\nthat you've worked on. "},{"time":"0:00","text":"Amy Smith: Some of the other\nthings we're working on are ways to do low-cost\nwater quality testing, so that communities can maintain\ntheir own water systems, know when they're working,\nknow when they treat them, etc. We're also looking at low-cost\nwater-treatment systems. One of the really exciting things\nis looking at solar water disinfection and improving the ability\nto be able to do that. "},{"time":"0:00","text":"CA: What's the bottleneck\npreventing this stuff getting from scale? Do you need to find entrepreneurs,\nor venture capitalists, or what do you need to take\nwhat you've got and get it to scale? "},{"time":"0:00","text":"AS: I think it's large numbers\nof people moving it forward. It's a difficult thing -- it's a marketplace\nwhich is very fragmented and a consumer population with no income. So you can't use the same models\nthat you use in the United States for making things move forward. And we're a pretty small staff, which is me.

If we are to call the tyranny of assumptions into question, and avoid doxa, the realm of the unquestioned, then we must be willing to subject our own assumptions to debate and discussion. It is in this spirit that I join into a discussion of one of the critical issues of our time, namely, how to mobilize different forms of capital for the project of state building. "},{"time":"00:39","text":"To put the assumptions very clearly: capitalism, after 150 years, has become acceptable, and so has democracy. If we looked in the world of 1945 and looked at the map of capitalist economies and democratic polities, they were the rare exception, not the norm. The question now, however, is both about which form of capitalism and which type of democratic participation. But we must acknowledge that this moment has brought about a rare consensus of assumptions. And that provides the ground for a type of action, because consensus of each moment allows us to act. And it is necessary, no matter how fragile or how provisional our consensus, to be able to move forward. "},{"time":"01:38","text":"But the majority of the world neither benefits from capitalism nor from democratic systems. Most of the globe experiences the state as repressive, as an organization that is concerned about denial of rights, about denial of justice, rather than provision of it. And in terms of experience of capitalism, there are two aspects that the rest of the globe experiences. First, extractive industry. Blood diamonds, smuggled emeralds, timber, that is cut right from under the poorest. Second is technical assistance. And technical assistance might shock you, but it's the worst form of -- today -- of the ugly face of the developed world to the developing countries. Tens of billions of dollars are supposedly spent on building capacity with people who are paid up to 1,500 dollars a day, who are incapable of thinking creatively, or organically. "},{"time":"02:56","text":"Next assumption -- and of course the events of July 7, I express my deep sympathy, and before that, September 11 -- have reminded us we do not live in three different worlds. We live in one world. But that's easily said. But we are not dealing with the implications of the one world that we are living in. And that is that if we want to have one world, this one world cannot be based on huge pockets of exclusion, and then inclusion for some. We must now finally come to think about the premises of a truly global world, in relationship to the regime of rights and responsibilities and accountabilities that are truly global in scope. Otherwise we will be missing this open moment in history, where we have a consensus on both the form of politics and the form of economics. "},{"time":"03:57","text":"What is one of these organizations to pick? We have three critical terms: economy, civil society and the state. I will not deal with those first two, except to say that uncritical transfer of assumptions, from one context to another, can only make for disaster. Economics taught in most of the elite universities are practically useless in my context. My country is dominated by drug economy and a mafia. Textbook economics does not work in my context, and I have very few recommendations from anybody as to how to put together a legal economy. The poverty of our knowledge must become the first basis of moving forward, and not imposition of the framework that works on the basis of mathematical modeling, for which I have enormous respect. My colleagues at Johns Hopkins were among the best. "},{"time":"04:58","text":"Second, instead of debating endlessly about what is the structure of the state, why don't we simplify and say, what are a series of functions that the state in the 21st century must perform? Clare Lockhart and I are writing a book on this; we hope to share that much widely with -- and third is that we could actually construct an index to measure comparatively how well these functions that we would agree on are being performed in different places. "},{"time":"05:28","text":"So what are these functions? We propose 10. And it's legitimate monopoly of means of violence, administrative control, management of public finances, investment in human capital, provision of citizenship rights, provision of infrastructure, management of the tangible and intangible assets of the state through regulation, creation of the market, international agreements, including public borrowing, and then, most importantly, rule of law. "},{"time":"05:54","text":"I won't elaborate. I hope the questions will give me an opportunity. This is a feasible goal, basically because, contrary to widespread assumption, I would argue that we know how to do this. Who would have imagined that Germany would be either united or democratic today, if you looked at it from the perspective of Oxford of 1943? But people at Oxford prepared for a democratic Germany and engaged in planning. And there are lots of other examples. "},{"time":"06:27","text":"Now in order to do this -- and this brings this group -- we have to rethink the notion of capital. The least important form of capital, in this project, is financial capital -- money. Money is not capital in most of the developing countries. It's just cash. Because it lacks the institutional, organizational, managerial forms to turn it into capital. And what is required is a combination of physical capital, institutional capital, human capital -- and security, of course, is critical, but so is information. "},{"time":"07:07","text":"Now, the issue that should concern us here -- and that's the challenge that I would like to pose to this group -- is again, it takes 16 years in your countries to produce somebody with a B.S. degree. It takes 20 years to produce somebody with a Ph.D. The first challenge is to rethink, fundamentally, the issue of the time. Do we need to repeat the modalities that we have inherited? Our educational systems are inherited from the 19th century. What is it that we need to do fundamentally to re-engage in a project, that capital formation is rapid? The absolute majority of the world's population are below 20, and they are growing larger and faster. They need different ways of being approached, different ways of being enfranchised, different ways of being skilled. And that's the first thing. "},{"time":"08:18","text":"Second is, you're problem solvers, but you're not engaging your global responsibility. You've stayed away from the problems of corruption. You only want clean environments in which to function. But if you don't think through the problems of corruption, who will? You stay away from design for development. You're great designers, but your designs are selfish. It's for your own immediate use. The world in which I operate operates with designs regarding roads, or dams, or provision of electricity that have not been revisited in 60 years. This is not right. It requires thinking. "},{"time":"09:07","text":"But, particularly, what we need more than anything else from this group is your imagination to be brought to bear on problems the way a meme is supposed to work. As the work on paradigms, long time ago showed -- Thomas Kuhn's work -- it's in the intersection of ideas that new developments -- true breakthroughs -- occur. And I hope that this group would be able to deal with the issue of state and development and the empowerment of the majority of the world's poor, through this means. Thank you. (Applause) "},{"time":"09:50","text":"Chris Anderson: So, Ashraf, until recently, you were the finance minister of Afghanistan, a country right at the middle of much of the world's agenda. Is the country gonna make it? Will democracy flourish? What scares you most? "},{"time":"10:05","text":"Ashraf Ghani: What scares me most is -- is you, lack of your engagement. (Laughter) You asked me. You know I always give the unconventional answer. No. But seriously, the issue of Afghanistan first has to be seen as, at least, a 10- to 20-year perspective. Today the world of globalization is on speed. Time has been compressed. And space does not exist for most people. But in my world -- you know, when I went back to Afghanistan after 23 years, space had expanded. Every conceivable form of infrastructure had broken down. I rode -- traveled -- travel between two cities that used to take three hours now took 12. So the first is when the scale is that, we need to recognize that just the simple things that are infrastructure -- it takes six years to deliver infrastructure. In our world. Any meaningful sort of thing. But the modality of attention, or what is happening today, what's happening tomorrow. "},{"time":"11:15","text":"Second is, when a country has been subjected to one of the most immense, brutal forms of exercise of power -- we had the Red Army for 10 continuous years, 110,000 strong, literally terrorizing. The sky: every Afghan sees the sky as a source of fear. We were bombed practically out of existence. Then, tens of thousands of people were trained in terrorism -- from all sides. The United States, Great Britain, joined for instance, Egyptian intelligence service to train thousands of people in resistance and urban terrorism. How to turn a bicycle into an instrument of terror. How to turn a donkey, a carthorse, anything. And the Russians, equally. So, when violence erupts in a country like Afghanistan, it's because of that legacy. But we have to understand that we've been incredibly lucky. I mean, I really can't believe how lucky I am here, standing in front of you, speaking. When I joined as finance minister, I thought that the chances of my living more than three years would not be more than five percent. Those were the risks. They were worth it. "},{"time":"12:46","text":"I think we can make it, and the reason we can make it is because of the people. You see, because, I mean -- I give you one statistic. 91 percent of the men in Afghanistan, 86 percent of the women, listen to at least three radio stations a day. In terms of their discourse, in terms of their sophistication of knowledge of the world, I think that I would dare say, they're much more sophisticated than rural Americans with college degrees and the bulk of Europeans -- because the world matters to them. And what is their predominant concern? Abandonment. Afghans have become deeply internationalist. "},{"time":"13:34","text":"You know, when I went back in December of 2001, I had absolutely no desire to work with the Afghan government because I'd lived as a nationalist. And I told them -- my people, with the Americans here -- separate. Yes, I have an advisory position with the U.N. I went through 10 Afghan provinces very rapidly. And everybody was telling me it was a different world. You know, they engage. They see engagement, global engagement, as absolutely necessary to the future of the ordinary people. And the thing that the ordinary Afghan is most concerned with is -- Clare Lockhart is here, so I'll recite a discussion she had with an illiterate woman in Northern Afghanistan. And that woman said she didn't care whether she had food on her table. What she worried about was whether there was a plan for the future, where her children could really have a different life. That gives me hope. CA: How is Afghanistan going to provide alternative income to the many people who are making their living off the drugs trade? "},{"time":"14:34","text":"AG: Certainly. Well, the first is, instead of sending a billion dollars on drug eradication and paying it to a couple of security companies, they should give this hundred billion dollars to 50 of the most critically innovative companies in the world to ask them to create one million jobs. The key to the drug eradication is jobs. Look, there's a very little known fact: countries that have a legal average income per capita of 1,000 dollars don't produce drugs. "},{"time":"15:07","text":"Second, textile. Trade is the key, not aid. The U.S. and Europe should give us a zero percent tariff. The textile industry is incredibly mobile. If you want us to be able to compete with China and to attract investment, we could probably attract four to six billion dollars quite easily in the textile sector, if there was zero tariffs -- would create the type of job. Cotton does not compete with opium; a t-shirt does. And we need to understand, it's the value chain. Look, the ordinary Afghan is sick and tired of hearing about microcredit. It is important, but what the ordinary women and men who engage in micro-production want is global access. They don't want to sell to the charity bazaars that are only for foreigners -- and the same bloody shirt embroidered time and again. What we want is a partnership with the Italian design firms. Yeah, we have the best embroiderers in the world! Why can't we do what was done with northern Italy? With the Put Out system? So I think economically, the critical issue really is to now think through. "},{"time":"16:29","text":"And what I will say here is that aid doesn't work. You know, the aid system is broken. The aid system does not have the knowledge, the vision, the ability. I'm all for it; after all, I raised a lot of it. Yeah, to be exact, you know, I managed to persuade the world that they had to give my country 27.5 billion. They didn't want to give us the money. "},{"time":"16:50","text":"CA: And it still didn't work? "},{"time":"16:52","text":"AG: No. It's not that it didn't work. It's that a dollar of private investment, in my judgment, is equal at least to 20 dollars of aid, in terms of the dynamic that it generates. Second is that one dollar of aid could be 10 cents; it could be 20 cents; or it could be four dollars. It depends on what form it comes, what degrees of conditionalities are attached to it. You know, the aid system, at first, was designed to benefit entrepreneurs of the developed countries, not to generate growth in the poor countries. And this is, again, one of those assumptions -- the way car seats are an assumption that we've inherited in governments, and doors. You would think that the US government would not think that American firms needed subsidizing to function in developing countries, provide advice, but they do. There's an entire weight of history vis-a-vis aid that now needs to be reexamined. If the goal is to build states that can credibly take care of themselves -- and I'm putting that proposition equally; you know I'm very harsh on my counterparts -- aid must end in each country in a definable period. And every year there must be progress on mobilization of domestic revenue and generation of the economy. Unless that kind of compact is entered into, you will not be able to sustain the consensus.

And that is, instinctively we've gone out and climbed over difficult places, went to more hostile places, and found out later, maybe to our surprise, that that's the reason we survived. And I feel very strongly that it's not good enough for us to have generations of kids that think that it's OK to look forward to a better version of a cell phone with a video in it.

That's the theme of my next 15 minutes here. And I think that the inspiration begins when you're very young:\n three-year-olds, up to 12-, 14-year-olds. What they look at is the most important thing. "},{"time":"02:33","text":"Let's take a snapshot at aviation. And there was a wonderful little short four-year time period when marvelous things happened. It started in 1908, when the Wright brothers flew in Paris, and everybody said, \"Ooh, hey, I can do that.\" There's only a few people that have flown in early 1908. In four years, 39 countries had hundreds of airplanes, thousand of pilots. Airplanes were invented by natural selection. Now you can say that intelligent design designs our airplanes of today, but there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanes. There were probably at least 30,000 different things tried, and when they crash and kill the pilot, don't try that again. The ones that flew and landed OK because there were no trained pilots who had good flying qualities by definition. So we, by making a whole bunch of attempts, thousands of attempts, in that four-year time period, we invented the concepts of the airplanes that we fly today. And that's why they're so safe, as we gave it a lot of chance to find what's good. That has not happened at all in space flying. There's only been two concepts tried -- two by the U.S. and one by the Russians. "},{"time":"03:45","text":"Well, who was inspired during that time period? Aviation Week asked me to make a list of who I thought were the movers and shakers of the first 100 years of aviation. And I wrote them down and I found out later that every one of them was a little kid in that wonderful renaissance of aviation. Well, what happened when I was a little kid was -- some pretty heavy stuff too. The jet age started: the missile age started. Von Braun was on there showing how to go to Mars -- and this was before Sputnik. And this was at a time when Mars was a hell of a lot more interesting than it is now. We thought there'd be animals there; we knew there were plants there; the colors change, right? But, you know, NASA screwed that up because they've sent these robots and they've landed it only in the deserts. "},{"time":"04:31","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"04:35","text":"If you look at what happened -- this little black line is as fast as man ever flew, and the red line is top-of-the-line military fighters and the blue line is commercial air transport. You notice here's a big jump when I was a little kid -- and I think that had something to do with giving me the courage to go out and try something that other people weren't having the courage to try. Well, what did I do when I was a kid? I didn't do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing and, well, we didn't have drugs in those days. But I did competition model airplanes. I spent about seven years during the Vietnam War flight-testing airplanes for the Air Force. And then I went in and I had a lot of fun building airplanes that people could build in their garages. And some 3,000 of those are flying. Of course, one of them is around the world Voyager. I founded another company in '82, which is my company now. And we have developed more than one new type of airplane every year since 1982. And there's a lot of them that I actually can't show you on this chart. "},{"time":"05:39","text":"The most impressive airplane ever, I believe, was designed only a dozen years after the first operational jet. Stayed in service till it was too rusty to fly, taken out of service. We retreated in '98 back to something that was developed in '56. What? The most impressive spaceship ever, I believe, was a Grumman Lunar Lander. It was a -- you know, it landed on the moon, take off of the moon, didn't need any maintenance guys -- that's kind of cool. We've lost that capability. We abandoned it in '72. This thing was designed three years after Gagarin first flew in space in 1961. Three years, and we can't do that now. Crazy.

These things tend to happen every 25 years. 40 years long, with an overlap. You can put that statement on all kinds of different technologies. The interesting thing -- by the way, the speed here, excuse me, higher-speed travel is the title of these innovation cycles. There is none here. These two new airplanes are the same speed as the DC8 that was done in 1958. Here's the biggie, and that is, you don't have innovation cycles if the government develops and the government uses it. You know, a good example, of course, is the DARPA net. Computers were used for artillery first, then IRS. But when we got it, now you have all the level of activity, all the benefit from it. Private sector has to do it. Keep that in mind. I put down innovation -- I've looked for innovation cycles in space; I found none.

In 2004, there were only two flights: two Russian Soyuz flights to the international manned station.

And I think I want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage to go out and try that as a small company. "},{"time":"08:42","text":"Well, first of all, what's going to happen next? The first industry will be a high volume, a lot of players. There's another one announced just last week. And it will be sub-orbital. And the reason it has to be sub-orbital is, there is not solutions for adequate safety to fly the public to orbit. The governments have been doing this -- three governments have been doing this for 45 years, and still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died. That's -- You don't want to run a business with that kind of a safety record. It'll be very high volume; we think 100,000 people will fly by 2020. I can't tell you when this will start, because I don't want my competition to know my schedule. But I think once it does, we will find solutions, and very quickly, you'll see those resort hotels in orbit. And that real easy thing to do, which is a swing around the moon so you have this cool view. And that will be really cool.

And the inventor is in this audience. Al Gore invented the Internet and because of that, something that we used for a whole year -- excuse me -- a whole decade for fun, became everything -- our commerce, our research, our communication and, if we let the Google guys think for another couple weekends, we can add a dozen more things to the list. (Laughter) And it won't be very long before you won't be able to convince kids that we didn't always have computers in our homes. So fun is defendable. "},{"time":"11:23","text":"OK, I want to show you kind of a busy chart, but in it is my prediction with what's going to happen. And in it also brings up another point, right here. There's a group of people that have come forward -- and you don't know all of them -- but the ones that have come forward were inspired as young children, this little three- to 15-year-old age, by us going to orbit and going to the moon here, right in this time period. Paul Allen, Elan Musk, Richard Branson, Jeff Bezos, the Ansari family, which is now funding the Russians' sub-orbital thing, Bob Bigelow, a private space station, and Carmack. These people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area, and I think it's a lot better than they put it in an area of a better cell phone or something -- but they're putting it in very -- areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability, and it will lead us into the next really big thing and it will allow us to explore. And I think eventually it will allow us to colonize and to keep us from going extinct. "},{"time":"12:40","text":"They were inspired by big progress. But look at the progress that's going on after that. There were a couple of examples here. The military fighters had a -- highest-performance military airplane was the SR71. It went a whole life cycle, got too rusty to fly, and was taken out of service. The Concorde doubled the speed for airline travel. It went a whole life cycle without competition, took out of service. And we're stuck back here with the same kind of capability for military fighters and commercial airline travel that we had back in the late '50s. "},{"time":"13:15","text":"But something is out there to inspire our kids now. And I'm talking about if you've got a baby now, or if you've got a 10-year-old now. What's out there is there's something really interesting going to happen here. Relatively soon, you'll be able to buy a ticket and fly higher and faster than the highest-performance military operational airplane. It's never happened before. The fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance has been, well, you know, you win the war in 12 minutes; why do you need something better? But I think when you guys start buying tickets and flying sub-orbital flights to space, very soon -- wait a minute, what's happening here, we'll have military fighters with sub-orbital capability, and I think very soon this. But the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first. OK, I look forward to a new \"capitalist's space race,\" let's call it. "},{"time":"14:12","text":"You remember the space race in the '60s was for national prestige, because we lost the first two milestones. We didn't lose them technically. The fact that we had the hardware to put something in orbit when we let Von Braun fly it -- you can argue that's not a technical loss. Sputnik wasn't a technical loss, but it was a prestige loss. America -- the world saw America as not being the leader in technology, and that was a very strong thing. And then we flew Alan Shepherd weeks after Gagarin, not months or decades, or whatever. So we had the capability. But America lost. We lost. And because of that, we made a big jump to recover it. "},{"time":"15:02","text":"Well, again, what's interesting here is we've lost to the Russians on the first couple of milestones already. You cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in America -- can't do it. You can buy it in Russia. You can fly with Russian hardware. This is available because a Russian space program is starving, and it's nice for them to get 20 million here and there to take one of the seats. It's commercial. It can be defined as space tourism. They are also offering a trip to go on this whip around the moon, like Apollo 8 was done. 100 million bucks -- hey, I can go to the moon. But, you know, would you have thought back in the '60s, when the space race was going on, that the first commercial capitalist-like thing to do to buy a ticket to go to the moon would be in Russian hardware? And would you have thought, would the Russians have thought, that when they first go to the moon in their developed hardware, the guys inside won't be Russians? Maybe it'll probably be a Japanese or an American billionaire? Well, that's weird: you know, it really is. But anyway, I think we need to beat them again. "},{"time":"16:17","text":"I think what we'll do is we'll see a successful, very successful, private space flight industry. Whether we're first or not really doesn't matter. The Russians actually flew a supersonic transport before the Concorde. And then they flew a few cargo flights, and took it out of service. I think you kind of see the same kind of parallel when the commercial stuff is offered. "},{"time":"16:46","text":"OK, we'll talk just a little bit about commercial development for human space flight. This little thing says here: five times what NASA's doing by 2020. I want to tell you, already there's about 1.5 billion to 1.7 billion investment in private space flight that is not government at all -- already, worldwide. If you read -- if you Google it, you'll find about half of that money, but there's twice of that being committed out there -- not spent yet, but being committed and planned for the next few years. Hey, that's pretty big. I'm predicting, though, as profitable as this industry is going to be -- and it certainly is profitable when you fly people at 200,000 dollars on something that you can actually operate at a tenth of that cost, or less -- this is going to be very profitable. I predict, also, that the investment that will flow into this will be somewhere around half of what the U.S. taxpayer spends for NASA's manned spacecraft work. And every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently by a factor of 10 to 15. And what that means is before we know it, the progress in human space flight, with no taxpayer dollars, will be at a level of about five times as much as the current NASA budgets for human space flight. And that is because it's us. It's private industry. You should never depend on the government to do this sort of stuff -- and we've done it for a long time. The NACA, before NASA, never developed an airliner and never ran an airline. But NASA is developing the space liner, always has, and runs the only space line, OK. And we've shied away from it because we're afraid of it. But starting back in June of 2004, when I showed that a little group out there actually can do it, can get a start with it, everything changed after that time.
