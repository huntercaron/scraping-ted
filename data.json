I want to start with a couple of -- I'm going to show some new images, and I'm going to recapitulate\njust four or five. Now, the slide show. I update the slide show\nevery time I give it. I add new images, because I learn more about it\nevery time I give it. It's like beach-combing, you know? Every time the tide comes in and out,\nyou find some more shells. Just in the last two days, we got\nthe new temperature records in January. This is just for\nthe United States of America. Historical average\nfor Januarys is 31 degrees; last month was 39.5 degrees. "},{"time":"06:38","text":"Now, I know that you wanted some more\nbad news about the environment -- I'm kidding. But these are the recapitulation slides, and then I'm going to go into new\nmaterial about what you can do. But I wanted to elaborate\non a couple of these. First of all, this is where\nwe're projected to go with the U.S. contribution\nto global warming, under business as usual. Efficiency in end-use electricity\nand end-use of all energy is the low-hanging fruit. Efficiency and conservation --\nit's not a cost; it's a profit. The sign is wrong. It's not negative; it's positive. These are investments\nthat pay for themselves. But they are also very effective\nin deflecting our path. "},{"time":"07:25","text":"Cars and trucks -- I talked\nabout that in the slideshow, but I want you to put it in perspective. It's an easy, visible target of concern -- and it should be -- but there is more global warming pollution\nthat comes from buildings than from cars and trucks. Cars and trucks are very significant, and we have the lowest\nstandards in the world. And so we should address that.\nBut it's part of the puzzle. Other transportation efficiency\nis as important as cars and trucks. Renewables at the current levels\nof technological efficiency can make this much difference. And with what Vinod, and John Doerr\nand others, many of you here -- there are a lot of people\ndirectly involved in this -- this wedge is going to grow\nmuch more rapidly than the current projection shows it. Carbon Capture and Sequestration --\nthat's what CCS stands for -- is likely to become the killer app\nthat will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels\nin a way that is safe. Not quite there yet. OK. Now, what can you do? "},{"time":"08:46","text":"Reduce emissions in your home. Most of these expenditures\nare also profitable. Insulation, better design. Buy green electricity where you can. I mentioned automobiles -- buy a hybrid. Use light rail. Figure out some of the other options\nthat are much better. It's important. "},{"time":"09:10","text":"Be a green consumer. You have choices with everything you buy, between things that have a harsh effect, or a much less harsh effect\non the global climate crisis. Consider this: Make a decision to live\na carbon-neutral life. Those of you who are good at branding, I'd love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way\nthat connects with the most people. It is easier than you think. It really is. A lot of us in here\nhave made that decision, and it is really pretty easy. It means reduce\nyour carbon dioxide emissions with the full range\nof choices that you make, and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not\ncompletely reduced. And what it means is elaborated\nat climatecrisis.net. "},{"time":"10:15","text":"There is a carbon calculator. Participant Productions convened -- with my active involvement -- the leading software writers in the world, on this arcane science\nof carbon calculation, to construct a consumer-friendly\ncarbon calculator. You can very precisely calculate\nwhat your CO2 emissions are, and then you will be given\noptions to reduce. And by the time the movie\ncomes out in May, this will be updated to 2.0, and we will have click-through\npurchases of offsets. "},{"time":"10:55","text":"Next, consider making\nyour business carbon-neutral. Again, some of us have done that, and it's not as hard as you think. Integrate climate solutions\ninto all of your innovations, whether you are from the technology, or entertainment, or design\nand architecture community. Invest sustainably. Majora mentioned this. Listen, if you have invested money\nwith managers who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance, don't ever again complain\nabout quarterly report CEO management. Over time, people do\nwhat you pay them to do. And if they judge how much\nthey're going to get paid on your capital that they've invested, based on the short-term returns, you're going to get short-term decisions. A lot more to be said about that. "},{"time":"11:52","text":"Become a catalyst of change. Teach others, learn about it,\ntalk about it. The movie is a movie version\nof the slideshow I gave two nights ago,\nexcept it's a lot more entertaining. And it comes out in May. Many of you here have the opportunity\nto ensure that a lot of people see it. Consider sending somebody to Nashville. Pick well. And I am personally going to train people\nto give this slideshow -- re-purposed, with some\nof the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach, and it's not just the slides,\nit's what they mean. And it's how they link together. And so I'm going to be conducting\na course this summer for a group of people that are\nnominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse, in communities all across the country, and we're going to update the slideshow\nfor all of them every single week, to keep it right on the cutting edge. Working with Larry Lessig, it will be,\nsomewhere in that process, posted with tools\nand limited-use copyrights, so that young people can remix it\nand do it in their own way. "},{"time":"13:12","text":"(Applause) "},{"time":"13:15","text":"Where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay\narm's length from politics? It doesn't mean\nthat if you're a Republican, that I'm trying to convince you\nto be a Democrat. We need Republicans as well. This used to be a bipartisan issue, and I know that\nin this group it really is. Become politically active. Make our democracy work the way\nit's supposed to work. Support the idea of capping\ncarbon dioxide emissions -- global warming pollution --\nand trading it. Here's why: as long as the United States\nis out of the world system, it's not a closed system. Once it becomes a closed system,\nwith U.S. participation, then everybody\nwho's on a board of directors -- how many people here\nserve on the board of directors of a corporation? Once it's a closed system, you will have legal liability\nif you do not urge your CEO to get the maximum income from reducing\nand trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided. The market will work\nto solve this problem -- if we can accomplish this. Help with the mass persuasion campaign\nthat will start this spring. We have to change the minds\nof the American people. Because presently, the politicians\ndo not have permission to do what needs to be done. "},{"time":"14:33","text":"And in our modern country, the role\nof logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power\nthe way it once did. It's now repetition of short, hot-button,\n30-second, 28-second television ads. We have to buy a lot of those ads. Let's re-brand global warming,\nas many of you have suggested. I like \"climate crisis\"\ninstead of \"climate collapse,\" but again, those of you\nwho are good at branding, I need your help on this. Somebody said the test\nwe're facing now, a scientist told me, is whether the combination\nof an opposable thumb and a neocortex is a viable combination. "},{"time":"15:11","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"15:13","text":"That's really true. "},{"time":"15:18","text":"I said the other night,\nand I'll repeat now: this is not a political issue. Again, the Republicans here --\nthis shouldn't be partisan. You have more influence\nthan some of us who are Democrats do. This is an opportunity. Not just this, but connected\nto the ideas that are here, to bring more coherence to them. We are one. "},{"time":"15:44","text":"Thank you very much, I appreciate it.

Among her many accomplishments, the MIT engineer received a MacArthur \"genius\" grant in 2004 and was the first woman to win the Lemelson-MIT Prize for turning her ideas into inventions."},"transcript":[{"time":"00:00","text":"In terms of invention, I'd like to tell you the tale\nof one of my favorite projects. I think it's one of the most exciting\nthat I'm working on, but I think it's also the simplest. "},{"time":"00:10","text":"It's a project that has the potential\nto make a huge impact around the world. It addresses one of the biggest\nhealth issues on the planet, the number one cause of death\nin children under five. Which is ...? Water-borne diseases?\nDiarrhea? Malnutrition? No. It's breathing the smoke\nfrom indoor cooking fires -- acute respiratory infections\ncaused by this. Can you believe that? "},{"time":"00:37","text":"I find this shocking\nand somewhat appalling. Can't we make\ncleaner burning cooking fuels? Can't we make better stoves? How is it that this can lead\nto over two million deaths every year? I know Bill Joy was talking to you\nabout the wonders of carbon nanotubes, so I'm going to talk to you\nabout the wonders of carbon macro-tubes, which is charcoal. "},{"time":"00:59","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"01:01","text":"So this is a picture of rural Haiti. Haiti is now 98 percent deforested. You'll see scenes like this\nall over the island. It leads to all sorts\nof environmental problems and problems that affect people\nthroughout the nation. A couple years ago\nthere was severe flooding that led to thousands of deaths -- that's directly attributable to the fact that there are no trees on the hills\nto stabilize the soil. So the rains come -- they go down the rivers\nand the flooding happens. "},{"time":"01:30","text":"Now one of the reasons\nwhy there are so few trees is this: people need to cook, and they harvest wood\nand they make charcoal in order to do it. It's not that people are ignorant\nto the environmental damage. They know perfectly well,\nbut they have no other choice. Fossil fuels are not available, and solar energy doesn't cook the way\nthat they like their food prepared. And so this is what they do. You'll find families like this who go out\ninto the forest to find a tree, cut it down and make charcoal out of it. So not surprisingly, there's a lot of effort that's been done\nto look at alternative cooking fuels. "},{"time":"02:09","text":"About four years ago, I took\na team of students down to Haiti and we worked with\nPeace Corps volunteers there. This is one such volunteer and this is a device that he had built\nin the village where he worked. And the idea was\nthat you could take waste paper; you could compress it and make briquettes\nthat could be used for fuel. But this device was very slow. So our engineering students\nwent to work on it and with some very simple changes, they were able to triple\nthe throughput of this device. So you could imagine\nthey were very excited about it. And they took the briquettes back to MIT\nso that they could test them. And one of the things\nthat they found was they didn't burn. So it was a little\ndiscouraging to the students. "},{"time":"02:51","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"02:52","text":"And in fact, if you look closely, right here you can see\nit says, \"US Peace Corps.\" As it turns out, there actually wasn't\nany waste paper in this village. And while it was a good use\nof government paperwork for this volunteer to bring it\nback with him to his village, it was 800 kilometers away. And so we thought perhaps\nthere might be a better way to come up with\nan alternative cooking fuel. "},{"time":"03:16","text":"What we wanted to do\nis we wanted to make a fuel that used something that was\nreadily available on the local level. You see these all over Haiti as well. They're small-scale sugar mills. And the waste product from them after you extract the juice\nfrom the sugarcane is called \"bagasse.\" It has no other use. It has no nutritional value,\nso they don't feed it to the animals. It just sits in a pile near the sugar mill\nuntil eventually they burn it. What we wanted to do was\nwe wanted to find a way to harness this waste resource\nand turn it into a fuel that would be something\nthat people could easily cook with, something like charcoal. So over the next couple of years, students and I worked\nto develop a process. "},{"time":"03:56","text":"So you start with the bagasse,\nand then you take a very simple kiln that you can make out of\na waste fifty five-gallon oil drum. After some time, after setting it on fire, you seal it to restrict the oxygen\nthat goes into the kiln, and then you end up\nwith this carbonized material here. However, you can't burn this. It's too fine and it burns too quickly\nto be useful for cooking. So we had to try to find a way\nto form it into useful briquettes. And conveniently,\none of my students was from Ghana, and he remembered a dish his mom\nused to make for him called \"kokonte,\" which is a very sticky porridge\nmade out of the cassava root. And so what we did was we looked, and we found that cassava\nis indeed grown in Haiti, under the name of \"manioc.\" In fact, it's grown all over the world -- yucca, tapioca, manioc, cassava,\nit's all the same thing -- a very starchy root vegetable. And you can make a very thick,\nsticky porridge out of it, which you can use to bind together\nthe charcoal briquettes. So we did this. We went down to Haiti. These are the graduates\nof the first Ecole de Charbon, or Charcoal Institute. And these -- "},{"time":"05:05","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"05:06","text":"That's right. So I'm actually\nan instructor at MIT as well as CIT. And these are the briquettes that we made. "},{"time":"05:16","text":"Now I'm going to take you\nto a different continent. This is India and this is the most commonly used\ncooking fuel in India. It's cow dung. And more than in Haiti,\nthis produces really smoky fires, and this is where you see\nthe health impacts of cooking with cow dung\nand biomass as a fuel. Kids and women\nare especially affected by it, because they're the ones\nwho are around the cooking fires. "},{"time":"05:42","text":"So we wanted to see if we could introduce\nthis charcoal-making technology there. Well, unfortunately,\nthey didn't have sugarcane and they didn't have cassava, but that didn't stop us. What we did was we found what were\nthe locally available sources of biomass. And there was wheat straw\nand there was rice straw in this area. And what we could use as a binder\nwas actually small amounts of cow manure, which they used ordinarily for their fuel. And we did side-by-side tests, and here you can see\nthe charcoal briquettes and here the cow dung. And you can see that it's a lot cleaner\nburning of a cooking fuel. And in fact, it heats the water\na lot more quickly. And so we were very happy, thus far. But one of the things that we found was when we did side-by-side\ncomparisons with wood charcoal, it didn't burn as long. And the briquettes crumbled a little bit and we lost energy as they fell apart\nas they were cooking. So we wanted to try to find a way\nto make a stronger briquette so that we could compete with\nwood charcoal in the markets in Haiti. "},{"time":"06:40","text":"So we went back to MIT, we took out the Instron machine and we figured out\nwhat sort of forces you needed in order to compress\na briquette to the level that you actually are getting\nimproved performance out of it? And at the same time that we had\nstudents in the lab looking at this, we also had community partners in Haiti\nworking to develop the process, to improve it and make it more accessible\nto people in the villages there. And after some time, we developed a low-cost press\nthat allows you to produce charcoal, which actually now burns not only -- actually, it burns longer,\ncleaner than wood charcoal. "},{"time":"07:22","text":"So now we're in a situation\nwhere we have a product, which is actually better than what\nyou can buy in Haiti in the marketplace, which is a very wonderful place to be. In Haiti alone, about 30 million trees\nare cut down every year. There's a possibility\nof this being implemented and saving a good portion of those. In addition, the revenue generated\nfrom that charcoal is 260 million dollars. That's an awful lot\nfor a country like Haiti -- with a population of eight million and an average income\nof less than 400 dollars. So this is where we're also moving ahead\nwith our charcoal project. "},{"time":"08:02","text":"And one of the things\nthat I think is also interesting, is I have a friend up at UC Berkeley\nwho's been doing risk analysis. And he's looked at the problem\nof the health impacts of burning wood versus charcoal. And he's found that worldwide,\nyou could prevent a million deaths switching from wood\nto charcoal as a cooking fuel. That's remarkable, but up until now, there weren't ways\nto do it without cutting down trees. But now we have a way that's using an agricultural\nwaste material to create a cooking fuel. "},{"time":"08:31","text":"One of the really exciting things, though, is something that came out of the trip\nthat I took to Ghana just last month. And I think it's the coolest thing, and it's even lower tech\nthan what you just saw, if you can imagine such a thing. Here it is. So what is this? This is corncobs turned into charcoal. And the beauty of this is\nthat you don't need to form briquettes -- it comes ready made. This is my $100 laptop, right here. And actually, like Nick,\nI brought samples. "},{"time":"09:01","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"09:03","text":"So we can pass these around. They're fully functional,\nfield-tested, ready to roll out. "},{"time":"09:11","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"09:15","text":"And I think one of the things which is also remarkable\nabout this technology, is that the technology\ntransfer is so easy. Compared to the sugarcane charcoal, where we have to teach people\nhow to form it into briquettes and you have the extra step\nof cooking the binder, this comes pre-briquetted. And this is about the most exciting\nthing in my life right now, which is perhaps\na sad commentary on my life. "},{"time":"09:39","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"09:41","text":"But once you see it,\nlike you guys in the front row -- All right, yeah, OK. So anyway -- "},{"time":"09:46","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"09:48","text":"Here it is. And this is, I think, a perfect example of what Robert Wright was talking about\nin those non-zero-sum things. So not only do you have health benefits, you have environmental benefits. But this is one\nof the incredibly rare situations where you also have economic benefits. People can make their own cooking fuel\nfrom waste products. They can generate income from this. They can save the money\nthat they were going to spend on charcoal and they can produce excess\nand sell it in the market to people who aren't making their own. It's really rare\nthat you don't have trade-offs between health and economics,\nor environment and economics. So this is a project\nthat I just find extremely exciting and I'm really looking forward\nto see where it takes us. "},{"time":"10:38","text":"So when we talk about, now,\nthe future we will create, one of the things\nthat I think is necessary is to have a very clear vision\nof the world that we live in. And now, I don't actually mean\nthe world that we live in. I mean the world where women\nspend two to three hours everyday grinding grain for their families to eat. I mean the world\nwhere advanced building materials means cement roofing tiles\nthat are made by hand, and where, when you work 10 hours a day, you're still only earning\n60 dollars in a month. I mean the world where women and children spend\n40 billion hours a year fetching water. That's as if the entire workforce\nof the state of California worked full time for a year\ndoing nothing but fetching water. "},{"time":"11:28","text":"It's a place where,\nfor example, if this were India, in this room, only three of us\nwould have a car. If this were Afghanistan, only one person in this room\nwould know how the use the Internet. If this were Zambia -- 300 of you would be farmers, 100 of you would have AIDS or HIV. And more than half of you would be living\non less than a dollar a day. These are the issues that we\nneed to come up with solutions for. These are the issues that\nwe need to be training our engineers, our designers, our business people,\nour entrepreneurs to be facing. These are the solutions\nthat we need to find. "},{"time":"12:10","text":"I have a few areas that I believe\nare especially important that we address. One of them is creating technologies to promote micro-finance\nand micro-enterprise, so that people who are living\nbelow the poverty line can find a way to move out -- and that they're not doing it using the same traditional\nbasket making, poultry rearing, etc. But there are new technologies\nand new products that they can make on a small scale. "},{"time":"12:35","text":"The next thing I believe is that we need to create\ntechnologies for poor farmers to add value to their own crops. And we need to rethink\nour development strategies, so that we're not promoting\neducational campaigns to get them to stop being farmers, but rather to stop being poor farmers. And we need to think\nabout how we can do that effectively. We need to work with the people\nin these communities and give them the resources\nand the tools that they need to solve their own problems. That's the best way to do it. We shouldn't be doing it from outside. So we need to create this future,\nand we need to start doing it now. "},{"time":"13:15","text":"Thank you.

One of the really exciting things\nis looking at solar water disinfection and improving the ability\nto be able to do that.

If we are to call the tyranny of assumptions into question, and avoid doxa, the realm of the unquestioned, then we must be willing to subject our own assumptions to debate and discussion. It is in this spirit that I join into a discussion of one of the critical issues of our time, namely, how to mobilize different forms of capital for the project of state building. "},{"time":"00:39","text":"To put the assumptions very clearly: capitalism, after 150 years, has become acceptable, and so has democracy. If we looked in the world of 1945 and looked at the map of capitalist economies and democratic polities, they were the rare exception, not the norm. The question now, however, is both about which form of capitalism and which type of democratic participation. But we must acknowledge that this moment has brought about a rare consensus of assumptions. And that provides the ground for a type of action, because consensus of each moment allows us to act. And it is necessary, no matter how fragile or how provisional our consensus, to be able to move forward. "},{"time":"01:38","text":"But the majority of the world neither benefits from capitalism nor from democratic systems. Most of the globe experiences the state as repressive, as an organization that is concerned about denial of rights, about denial of justice, rather than provision of it. And in terms of experience of capitalism, there are two aspects that the rest of the globe experiences. First, extractive industry. Blood diamonds, smuggled emeralds, timber, that is cut right from under the poorest. Second is technical assistance. And technical assistance might shock you, but it's the worst form of -- today -- of the ugly face of the developed world to the developing countries. Tens of billions of dollars are supposedly spent on building capacity with people who are paid up to 1,500 dollars a day, who are incapable of thinking creatively, or organically. "},{"time":"02:56","text":"Next assumption -- and of course the events of July 7, I express my deep sympathy, and before that, September 11 -- have reminded us we do not live in three different worlds. We live in one world. But that's easily said. But we are not dealing with the implications of the one world that we are living in. And that is that if we want to have one world, this one world cannot be based on huge pockets of exclusion, and then inclusion for some. We must now finally come to think about the premises of a truly global world, in relationship to the regime of rights and responsibilities and accountabilities that are truly global in scope. Otherwise we will be missing this open moment in history, where we have a consensus on both the form of politics and the form of economics. "},{"time":"03:57","text":"What is one of these organizations to pick? We have three critical terms: economy, civil society and the state. I will not deal with those first two, except to say that uncritical transfer of assumptions, from one context to another, can only make for disaster. Economics taught in most of the elite universities are practically useless in my context. My country is dominated by drug economy and a mafia. Textbook economics does not work in my context, and I have very few recommendations from anybody as to how to put together a legal economy. The poverty of our knowledge must become the first basis of moving forward, and not imposition of the framework that works on the basis of mathematical modeling, for which I have enormous respect. My colleagues at Johns Hopkins were among the best. "},{"time":"04:58","text":"Second, instead of debating endlessly about what is the structure of the state, why don't we simplify and say, what are a series of functions that the state in the 21st century must perform? Clare Lockhart and I are writing a book on this; we hope to share that much widely with -- and third is that we could actually construct an index to measure comparatively how well these functions that we would agree on are being performed in different places. "},{"time":"05:28","text":"So what are these functions? We propose 10. And it's legitimate monopoly of means of violence, administrative control, management of public finances, investment in human capital, provision of citizenship rights, provision of infrastructure, management of the tangible and intangible assets of the state through regulation, creation of the market, international agreements, including public borrowing, and then, most importantly, rule of law. "},{"time":"05:54","text":"I won't elaborate. I hope the questions will give me an opportunity. This is a feasible goal, basically because, contrary to widespread assumption, I would argue that we know how to do this. Who would have imagined that Germany would be either united or democratic today, if you looked at it from the perspective of Oxford of 1943? But people at Oxford prepared for a democratic Germany and engaged in planning. And there are lots of other examples. "},{"time":"06:27","text":"Now in order to do this -- and this brings this group -- we have to rethink the notion of capital. The least important form of capital, in this project, is financial capital -- money. Money is not capital in most of the developing countries. It's just cash. Because it lacks the institutional, organizational, managerial forms to turn it into capital. And what is required is a combination of physical capital, institutional capital, human capital -- and security, of course, is critical, but so is information. "},{"time":"07:07","text":"Now, the issue that should concern us here -- and that's the challenge that I would like to pose to this group -- is again, it takes 16 years in your countries to produce somebody with a B.S. degree. It takes 20 years to produce somebody with a Ph.D. The first challenge is to rethink, fundamentally, the issue of the time. Do we need to repeat the modalities that we have inherited? Our educational systems are inherited from the 19th century. What is it that we need to do fundamentally to re-engage in a project, that capital formation is rapid? The absolute majority of the world's population are below 20, and they are growing larger and faster. They need different ways of being approached, different ways of being enfranchised, different ways of being skilled. And that's the first thing. "},{"time":"08:18","text":"Second is, you're problem solvers, but you're not engaging your global responsibility. You've stayed away from the problems of corruption. You only want clean environments in which to function. But if you don't think through the problems of corruption, who will? You stay away from design for development. You're great designers, but your designs are selfish. It's for your own immediate use. The world in which I operate operates with designs regarding roads, or dams, or provision of electricity that have not been revisited in 60 years. This is not right. It requires thinking. "},{"time":"09:07","text":"But, particularly, what we need more than anything else from this group is your imagination to be brought to bear on problems the way a meme is supposed to work. As the work on paradigms, long time ago showed -- Thomas Kuhn's work -- it's in the intersection of ideas that new developments -- true breakthroughs -- occur. And I hope that this group would be able to deal with the issue of state and development and the empowerment of the majority of the world's poor, through this means. Thank you. (Applause) "},{"time":"09:50","text":"Chris Anderson: So, Ashraf, until recently, you were the finance minister of Afghanistan, a country right at the middle of much of the world's agenda.

(Laughter) You asked me. You know I always give the unconventional answer. No. But seriously, the issue of Afghanistan first has to be seen as, at least, a 10- to 20-year perspective. Today the world of globalization is on speed. Time has been compressed. And space does not exist for most people. But in my world -- you know, when I went back to Afghanistan after 23 years, space had expanded. Every conceivable form of infrastructure had broken down. I rode -- traveled -- travel between two cities that used to take three hours now took 12. So the first is when the scale is that, we need to recognize that just the simple things that are infrastructure -- it takes six years to deliver infrastructure. In our world. Any meaningful sort of thing. But the modality of attention, or what is happening today, what's happening tomorrow. "},{"time":"11:15","text":"Second is, when a country has been subjected to one of the most immense, brutal forms of exercise of power -- we had the Red Army for 10 continuous years, 110,000 strong, literally terrorizing. The sky: every Afghan sees the sky as a source of fear. We were bombed practically out of existence. Then, tens of thousands of people were trained in terrorism -- from all sides. The United States, Great Britain, joined for instance, Egyptian intelligence service to train thousands of people in resistance and urban terrorism. How to turn a bicycle into an instrument of terror. How to turn a donkey, a carthorse, anything. And the Russians, equally. So, when violence erupts in a country like Afghanistan, it's because of that legacy. But we have to understand that we've been incredibly lucky. I mean, I really can't believe how lucky I am here, standing in front of you, speaking. When I joined as finance minister, I thought that the chances of my living more than three years would not be more than five percent. Those were the risks. They were worth it. "},{"time":"12:46","text":"I think we can make it, and the reason we can make it is because of the people. You see, because, I mean -- I give you one statistic. 91 percent of the men in Afghanistan, 86 percent of the women, listen to at least three radio stations a day. In terms of their discourse, in terms of their sophistication of knowledge of the world, I think that I would dare say, they're much more sophisticated than rural Americans with college degrees and the bulk of Europeans -- because the world matters to them. And what is their predominant concern? Abandonment. Afghans have become deeply internationalist. "},{"time":"13:34","text":"You know, when I went back in December of 2001, I had absolutely no desire to work with the Afghan government because I'd lived as a nationalist. And I told them -- my people, with the Americans here -- separate. Yes, I have an advisory position with the U.N. I went through 10 Afghan provinces very rapidly. And everybody was telling me it was a different world. You know, they engage. They see engagement, global engagement, as absolutely necessary to the future of the ordinary people. And the thing that the ordinary Afghan is most concerned with is -- Clare Lockhart is here, so I'll recite a discussion she had with an illiterate woman in Northern Afghanistan. And that woman said she didn't care whether she had food on her table. What she worried about was whether there was a plan for the future, where her children could really have a different life. That gives me hope. CA: How is Afghanistan going to provide alternative income to the many people who are making their living off the drugs trade? "},{"time":"14:34","text":"AG: Certainly. Well, the first is, instead of sending a billion dollars on drug eradication and paying it to a couple of security companies, they should give this hundred billion dollars to 50 of the most critically innovative companies in the world to ask them to create one million jobs. The key to the drug eradication is jobs. Look, there's a very little known fact: countries that have a legal average income per capita of 1,000 dollars don't produce drugs. "},{"time":"15:07","text":"Second, textile. Trade is the key, not aid. The U.S. and Europe should give us a zero percent tariff. The textile industry is incredibly mobile. If you want us to be able to compete with China and to attract investment, we could probably attract four to six billion dollars quite easily in the textile sector, if there was zero tariffs -- would create the type of job. Cotton does not compete with opium; a t-shirt does. And we need to understand, it's the value chain. Look, the ordinary Afghan is sick and tired of hearing about microcredit. It is important, but what the ordinary women and men who engage in micro-production want is global access. They don't want to sell to the charity bazaars that are only for foreigners -- and the same bloody shirt embroidered time and again. What we want is a partnership with the Italian design firms. Yeah, we have the best embroiderers in the world! Why can't we do what was done with northern Italy? With the Put Out system? So I think economically, the critical issue really is to now think through. "},{"time":"16:29","text":"And what I will say here is that aid doesn't work. You know, the aid system is broken. The aid system does not have the knowledge, the vision, the ability. I'm all for it; after all, I raised a lot of it. Yeah, to be exact, you know, I managed to persuade the world that they had to give my country 27.5 billion. They didn't want to give us the money. "},{"time":"16:50","text":"CA: And it still didn't work? "},{"time":"16:52","text":"AG: No. It's not that it didn't work. It's that a dollar of private investment, in my judgment, is equal at least to 20 dollars of aid, in terms of the dynamic that it generates. Second is that one dollar of aid could be 10 cents; it could be 20 cents; or it could be four dollars. It depends on what form it comes, what degrees of conditionalities are attached to it. You know, the aid system, at first, was designed to benefit entrepreneurs of the developed countries, not to generate growth in the poor countries. And this is, again, one of those assumptions -- the way car seats are an assumption that we've inherited in governments, and doors. You would think that the US government would not think that American firms needed subsidizing to function in developing countries, provide advice, but they do. There's an entire weight of history vis-a-vis aid that now needs to be reexamined. If the goal is to build states that can credibly take care of themselves -- and I'm putting that proposition equally; you know I'm very harsh on my counterparts -- aid must end in each country in a definable period. And every year there must be progress on mobilization of domestic revenue and generation of the economy. Unless that kind of compact is entered into, you will not be able to sustain the consensus.

And that is, instinctively we've gone out and climbed over difficult places, went to more hostile places, and found out later, maybe to our surprise, that that's the reason we survived. And I feel very strongly that it's not good enough for us to have generations of kids that think that it's OK to look forward to a better version of a cell phone with a video in it.

That's the theme of my next 15 minutes here. And I think that the inspiration begins when you're very young:\n three-year-olds, up to 12-, 14-year-olds. What they look at is the most important thing. "},{"time":"02:33","text":"Let's take a snapshot at aviation. And there was a wonderful little short four-year time period when marvelous things happened. It started in 1908, when the Wright brothers flew in Paris, and everybody said, \"Ooh, hey, I can do that.\" There's only a few people that have flown in early 1908. In four years, 39 countries had hundreds of airplanes, thousand of pilots. Airplanes were invented by natural selection. Now you can say that intelligent design designs our airplanes of today, but there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanes. There were probably at least 30,000 different things tried, and when they crash and kill the pilot, don't try that again. The ones that flew and landed OK because there were no trained pilots who had good flying qualities by definition. So we, by making a whole bunch of attempts, thousands of attempts, in that four-year time period, we invented the concepts of the airplanes that we fly today. And that's why they're so safe, as we gave it a lot of chance to find what's good. That has not happened at all in space flying. There's only been two concepts tried -- two by the U.S. and one by the Russians. "},{"time":"03:45","text":"Well, who was inspired during that time period? Aviation Week asked me to make a list of who I thought were the movers and shakers of the first 100 years of aviation. And I wrote them down and I found out later that every one of them was a little kid in that wonderful renaissance of aviation. Well, what happened when I was a little kid was -- some pretty heavy stuff too. The jet age started: the missile age started. Von Braun was on there showing how to go to Mars -- and this was before Sputnik. And this was at a time when Mars was a hell of a lot more interesting than it is now. We thought there'd be animals there; we knew there were plants there; the colors change, right? But, you know, NASA screwed that up because they've sent these robots and they've landed it only in the deserts.

You notice here's a big jump when I was a little kid -- and I think that had something to do with giving me the courage to go out and try something that other people weren't having the courage to try. Well, what did I do when I was a kid? I didn't do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing and, well, we didn't have drugs in those days. But I did competition model airplanes. I spent about seven years during the Vietnam War flight-testing airplanes for the Air Force. And then I went in and I had a lot of fun building airplanes that people could build in their garages. And some 3,000 of those are flying. Of course, one of them is around the world Voyager. I founded another company in '82, which is my company now. And we have developed more than one new type of airplane every year since 1982. And there's a lot of them that I actually can't show you on this chart. "},{"time":"05:39","text":"The most impressive airplane ever, I believe, was designed only a dozen years after the first operational jet. Stayed in service till it was too rusty to fly, taken out of service. We retreated in '98 back to something that was developed in '56. What? The most impressive spaceship ever, I believe, was a Grumman Lunar Lander. It was a -- you know, it landed on the moon, take off of the moon, didn't need any maintenance guys -- that's kind of cool. We've lost that capability. We abandoned it in '72. This thing was designed three years after Gagarin first flew in space in 1961. Three years, and we can't do that now. Crazy.

The interesting thing -- by the way, the speed here, excuse me, higher-speed travel is the title of these innovation cycles. There is none here. These two new airplanes are the same speed as the DC8 that was done in 1958. Here's the biggie, and that is, you don't have innovation cycles if the government develops and the government uses it. You know, a good example, of course, is the DARPA net. Computers were used for artillery first, then IRS. But when we got it, now you have all the level of activity, all the benefit from it.

In 2004, there were only two flights: two Russian Soyuz flights to the international manned station.

The first industry will be a high volume, a lot of players. There's another one announced just last week. And it will be sub-orbital. And the reason it has to be sub-orbital is, there is not solutions for adequate safety to fly the public to orbit. The governments have been doing this -- three governments have been doing this for 45 years, and still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died. That's -- You don't want to run a business with that kind of a safety record. It'll be very high volume; we think 100,000 people will fly by 2020. I can't tell you when this will start, because I don't want my competition to know my schedule. But I think once it does, we will find solutions, and very quickly, you'll see those resort hotels in orbit. And that real easy thing to do, which is a swing around the moon so you have this cool view. And that will be really cool.

And the inventor is in this audience. Al Gore invented the Internet and because of that, something that we used for a whole year -- excuse me -- a whole decade for fun, became everything -- our commerce, our research, our communication and, if we let the Google guys think for another couple weekends, we can add a dozen more things to the list.

There's a group of people that have come forward -- and you don't know all of them -- but the ones that have come forward were inspired as young children, this little three- to 15-year-old age, by us going to orbit and going to the moon here, right in this time period. Paul Allen, Elan Musk, Richard Branson, Jeff Bezos, the Ansari family, which is now funding the Russians' sub-orbital thing, Bob Bigelow, a private space station, and Carmack. These people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area, and I think it's a lot better than they put it in an area of a better cell phone or something -- but they're putting it in very -- areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability, and it will lead us into the next really big thing and it will allow us to explore. And I think eventually it will allow us to colonize and to keep us from going extinct. "},{"time":"12:40","text":"They were inspired by big progress. But look at the progress that's going on after that. There were a couple of examples here. The military fighters had a -- highest-performance military airplane was the SR71. It went a whole life cycle, got too rusty to fly, and was taken out of service. The Concorde doubled the speed for airline travel. It went a whole life cycle without competition, took out of service. And we're stuck back here with the same kind of capability for military fighters and commercial airline travel that we had back in the late '50s. "},{"time":"13:15","text":"But something is out there to inspire our kids now. And I'm talking about if you've got a baby now, or if you've got a 10-year-old now. What's out there is there's something really interesting going to happen here. Relatively soon, you'll be able to buy a ticket and fly higher and faster than the highest-performance military operational airplane. It's never happened before. The fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance has been, well, you know, you win the war in 12 minutes; why do you need something better? But I think when you guys start buying tickets and flying sub-orbital flights to space, very soon -- wait a minute, what's happening here, we'll have military fighters with sub-orbital capability, and I think very soon this. But the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first. OK, I look forward to a new \"capitalist's space race,\" let's call it. "},{"time":"14:12","text":"You remember the space race in the '60s was for national prestige, because we lost the first two milestones. We didn't lose them technically. The fact that we had the hardware to put something in orbit when we let Von Braun fly it -- you can argue that's not a technical loss. Sputnik wasn't a technical loss, but it was a prestige loss. America -- the world saw America as not being the leader in technology, and that was a very strong thing. And then we flew Alan Shepherd weeks after Gagarin, not months or decades, or whatever. So we had the capability. But America lost. We lost. And because of that, we made a big jump to recover it. "},{"time":"15:02","text":"Well, again, what's interesting here is we've lost to the Russians on the first couple of milestones already. You cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in America -- can't do it. You can buy it in Russia. You can fly with Russian hardware. This is available because a Russian space program is starving, and it's nice for them to get 20 million here and there to take one of the seats. It's commercial. It can be defined as space tourism. They are also offering a trip to go on this whip around the moon, like Apollo 8 was done. 100 million bucks -- hey, I can go to the moon. But, you know, would you have thought back in the '60s, when the space race was going on, that the first commercial capitalist-like thing to do to buy a ticket to go to the moon would be in Russian hardware? And would you have thought, would the Russians have thought, that when they first go to the moon in their developed hardware, the guys inside won't be Russians? Maybe it'll probably be a Japanese or an American billionaire? Well, that's weird: you know, it really is. But anyway, I think we need to beat them again. "},{"time":"16:17","text":"I think what we'll do is we'll see a successful, very successful, private space flight industry. Whether we're first or not really doesn't matter. The Russians actually flew a supersonic transport before the Concorde. And then they flew a few cargo flights, and took it out of service. I think you kind of see the same kind of parallel when the commercial stuff is offered. "},{"time":"16:46","text":"OK, we'll talk just a little bit about commercial development for human space flight. This little thing says here: five times what NASA's doing by 2020. I want to tell you, already there's about 1.5 billion to 1.7 billion investment in private space flight that is not government at all -- already, worldwide. If you read -- if you Google it, you'll find about half of that money, but there's twice of that being committed out there -- not spent yet, but being committed and planned for the next few years. Hey, that's pretty big. I'm predicting, though, as profitable as this industry is going to be -- and it certainly is profitable when you fly people at 200,000 dollars on something that you can actually operate at a tenth of that cost, or less -- this is going to be very profitable. I predict, also, that the investment that will flow into this will be somewhere around half of what the U.S. taxpayer spends for NASA's manned spacecraft work. And every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently by a factor of 10 to 15. And what that means is before we know it, the progress in human space flight, with no taxpayer dollars, will be at a level of about five times as much as the current NASA budgets for human space flight. And that is because it's us. It's private industry. You should never depend on the government to do this sort of stuff -- and we've done it for a long time. The NACA, before NASA, never developed an airliner and never ran an airline. But NASA is developing the space liner, always has, and runs the only space line, OK. And we've shied away from it because we're afraid of it. But starting back in June of 2004, when I showed that a little group out there actually can do it, can get a start with it, everything changed after that time.

As chief of design for the BMW Group, Chris Bangle has overseen cars that have been seen the world over, including BMW 7 Series and the Z4 roadster."},"transcript":[{"time":"00:01","text":"What I want to talk about is, as background, is the idea that cars are art. This is actually quite meaningful to me, because car designers tend to be a little bit low on the totem pole -- we don't do coffee table books with just one lamp inside of it -- and cars are thought so much as a product that it's a little bit difficult to get into the aesthetic side under the same sort of terminology that one would discuss art. And so cars, as art, brings it into an emotional plane -- if you accept that -- that you have to deal with on the same level you would with art with a capital A. "},{"time":"00:34","text":"Now at this point you're going to see a picture of Michelangelo. This is completely different than automobiles. Automobiles are self-moving things, right? Elevators are automobiles. And they're not very emotional; they solve a purpose; and certainly automobiles have been around for 100 years and have made our lives functionally a lot better in many ways; they've also been a real pain in the ass, because automobiles are really the thing we have to solve. We have to solve the pollution, we have to solve the congestion -- but that's not what interests me in this speech. "},{"time":"01:07","text":"What interests me in this speech is cars. Automobiles may be what you use, but cars are what we are, in many ways. And as long as we can solve the problems of automobiles, and I believe we can, with fuel cells or hydrogen, like BMW is really hip on, and lots of other things, then I think we can look past that and try and understand why this hook is in many of us -- of this car-y-ness -- and what that means, what we can learn from it. That's what I want to get to. Cars are not a suit of clothes; cars are an avatar. Cars are an expansion of yourself: they take your thoughts, your ideas, your emotions, and they multiply it -- your anger, whatever. It's an avatar. It's a super-waldo that you happen to be inside of, and if you feel sexy, the car is sexy. And if you're full of road rage, you've got a \"Chevy: Like a Rock,\" right? "},{"time":"01:56","text":"Cars are a sculpture -- did you know this? That every car you see out there is sculpted by hand. Many people think, \"Well, it's computers, and it's done by machines and stuff like that.\" Well, they reproduce it, but the originals are all done by hand. It's done by men and women who believe a lot in their craft. And they put that same kind of tension into the sculpting of a car that you do in a great sculpture that you would go and look at in a museum. That tension between the need to express, the need to discover, then you put something new into it, and at the same time you have bounds of craftsmanship. Rules that say, this is how you handle surfaces; this is what control is all about; this is how you show you're a master of your craft. And that tension, that discovery, that push for something new -- and at the same time, that sense of obligation to the regards of craftsmanship -- that's as strong in cars as it is in anything. We work in clay, which hasn't changed much since Michelangelo started screwing around with it, and there's a very interesting analogy to that too. Real quickly -- Michelangelo once said he's there to \"discover the figure within,\" OK? There we go, the automobile. That was 100 years right there -- did you catch that? Between that one there, and that one there, it changed a lot didn't it? OK, it's not marketing; there's a very interesting car concept here, but the marketing part is not what I want to talk about here. I want to talk about this. Why it means you have to wash a car, what is it, that sensuality you have to touch about it? That's the sculpture that goes into it. That sensuality. And it's done by men and women working just like this, making cars. "},{"time":"03:26","text":"Now this little quote about sculpture from Henry Moore, I believe that that \"pressure within\" that Moore's talking about -- at least when it comes to cars -- comes right back to this idea of the mean. It's that will to live, that need to survive, to express itself, that comes in a car, and takes over people like me. And we tell other people, \"Do this, do this, do this,\" until this thing comes alive. We are completely infected. And beauty can be the result of this infectiousness; it's quite wonderful. This sculpture is, of course, at the heart of all of it, and it's really what puts the craftsmanship into our cars. And it's not a whole lot different, really, when they're working like this, or when somebody works like this. It's that same kind of commitment, that same kind of beauty. "},{"time":"04:06","text":"Now, now I get to the point. I want to talk about cars as art. Art, in the Platonic sense, is truth; it's beauty, and love. Now this is really where designers in car business diverge from the engineers. We don't really have a problem talking about love. We don't have a problem talking about truth or beauty in that sense. That's what we're searching for -- when we're working our craft, we are really trying to find that truth out there. We're not trying to find vanity and beauty. We're trying to find the beauty in the truth. However, engineers tend to look at things a little bit more Newtonian, instead of this quantum approach. We're dealing with irrationalisms, and we're dealing with paradoxes that we admit exist, and the engineers tend to look things a little bit more like two and two is four, and if you get 4.0 it's better, and 4.000 is even better. And that sometimes leads to bit of a divergence in why we're doing what we're doing. We've pretty much accepted the fact, though, that we are the women in the organization at BMW -- BMW is a very manly type business, -- men, men, men; it's engineers. And we're kind of the female side to that. That's OK, that's cool. You go off and be manly. We're going to be a little bit more female. Because what we're interested in is finding form that's more than just a function. "},{"time":"05:14","text":"We're interested in finding beauty that's more than just an aesthetic; it's really a truth. And I think this idea of soul, as being at the heart of great cars, is very applicable. You all know it. You know a car when you've seen it, with soul. You know how strong this is. Well, this experience of love, and the experience of design, to me, are interchangeable. And now I'm coming to my story. "},{"time":"05:34","text":"I discovered something about love and design through a project called Deep Blue. And first of all, you have to go with me for a second, and say, you know, you could take the word \"love\" out of a lot of things in our society, put the word \"design\" in, and it still works, like this quote here, you know. It kind of works, you know? You can understand that. It works in truisms. \"All is fair in design and war.\" Certainly we live in a competitive society. I think this one here, there's a pop song that really describes Philippe Starck for me, you know, this is like you know, this is like puppy love, you know, this is cool right? Toothbrush, cool. It really only gets serious when you look at something like this. OK? "},{"time":"06:12","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"06:14","text":"This is one substitution that I believe all of us, in design management, are guilty of. And this idea that there is more to love, more to design, when it gets down to your neighbor, your other, it can be physical like this, and maybe in the future it will be. But right now it's in dealing with our own people, our own teams who are doing the creating. So, to my story. The idea of people-work is what we work with here, and I have to make a bond with my designers when we're creating BMWs. We have to have a shared intimacy, a shared vision -- that means we have to work as one family; we have to understand ourselves that way. There's good times; there's interesting times; and there's some stress times too. You want to do cars, you've got to go outside. You've got to do cars in the rain; you've got to do cars in the snow. That's, by the way, is a presentation we made to our board of directors. We haul their butts out in the snow, too. You want to know cars outside? Well, you've got to stand outside to do this. And because these are artists, they have very artistic temperaments. All right? Now one thing about art is, art is discovery, and art is discovering yourself through your art. Right? And one thing about cars is we're all a little bit like Pygmalion, we are completely in love with our own creations. This is one of my favorite paintings, it really describes our relationship with cars. This is sick beyond belief. "},{"time":"07:37","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"07:39","text":"But because of this, the intimacy with which we work together as a team takes on a new dimension, a new meaning. We have a shared center; we have a shared focus -- that car stays at the middle of all our relationships. And it's my job, in the competitive process, to narrow this down. I heard today about Joseph's death genes that have to go in and kill cell reproduction. You know, that's what I have to do sometimes. We start out with 10 cars; we narrow it down to five cars, down to three cars, down to two cars, down to one car, and I'm in the middle of that killing, basically. Someone's love, someone's baby. This is very difficult, and you have to have a bond with your team that permits you to do this, because their life is wrapped up in that too. They've got that gene infected in them as well, and they want that to live, more than anything else. "},{"time":"08:35","text":"Well, this project, Deep Blue, put me in contact with my team in a way that I never expected, and I want to pass it on to you, because I want you to reflect on this, perhaps in your own relationships. We wanted to a do a car which was a complete leap of faith for BMW. We wanted to do a team which was so removed from the way we'd done it, that I only had a phone number that connected me to them. So, what we did was: instead of having a staff of artists that are just your wrist, we decided to free up a team of creative designers and engineers to find out what's the successor to the SUV phenomenon in America. This is 1996 we did this project. And so we sent them off with this team name, Deep Blue. Now many people know Deep Blue from IBM -- we actually stole it from them because we figured if anybody read our faxes they'd think we're talking about computers. It turned out it was quite clever because Deep Blue, in a company like BMW, has a hook -- \"Deep Blue,\" wow, cool name. So people get wrapped up in it. And we took a team of designers, and we sent them off to America. And we gave them a budget, what we thought was a set of deliverables, a timetable, and nothing else. Like I said, I just had a phone number that connected me to them. "},{"time":"09:39","text":"And a group of engineers worked in Germany, and the idea was they would work separately on this problem of what's the successor to the SUV. They would come together, compare notes. Then they would work apart, come together, and they would produce together a monumental set of diverse opinions that didn't pollute each other's ideas -- but at the same time came together and resolved the problems. Hopefully, really understand the customer at its heart, where the customer is, live with them in America. So -- sent the team off, and actually something different happened. They went other places. "},{"time":"10:12","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"10:15","text":"They disappeared, quite honestly, and all I got was postcards. Now, I got some postcards of these guys in Las Vegas, and I got some postcards of these guys in the Grand Canyon, and I got these postcards of Niagara Falls, and pretty soon they're in New York, and I don't know where else. And I'm telling myself, \"This is going to be a great car, they're doing research that I've never even thought about before.\" Right? And they decided that instead of, like, having a studio, and six or seven apartments, it was cheaper to rent Elizabeth Taylor's ex-house in Malibu. And -- at least they told me it was her house, I guess it was at one time, she had a party there or something. But anyway, this was the house, and they all lived there. Now this is 24/7 living, half-a-dozen people who'd left their -- some had left their wives behind and families behind, and they literally lived in this house for the entire six months the project was in America, but the first three months were the most intensive. And one of the young women in the project, she was a fantastic lady, she actually built her room in the bathroom. The bathroom was so big, she built the bed over the bathtub -- it's quite fascinating. "},{"time":"11:33","text":"On the other hand, I didn't know anything about this. OK? Nothing. This is all going on, and all I'm getting is postcards of these guys in Las Vegas, or whatever, saying, \"Don't worry Chris, this is really going to be good.\" OK? So my concept of what a design studio was probably -- I wasn't up to speed on where these guys were. "},{"time":"11:51","text":"However, the engineers back in Munich had taken on this kind of Newtonian solution, and they were trying to find how many cup holders can dance on the head of a pin, and, you know, these really serious questions that are confronting the modern consumer. And one was hoping that these two teams would get together, and this collusion of incredible creativity, under these incredible surroundings, and these incredibly stressed-out engineers, would create some incredible solutions. Well, what I didn't know was, and what we found out was -- these guys, they can't even like talk to each other under those conditions. You get a divergence of Newtonian and quantum thinking at that point, you have a split in your dialog that is so deep, and so far, that they cannot bring this together at all. "},{"time":"12:42","text":"And so we had our first meeting, after three months, in Tiburon, which is just up the road from here -- you know Tiburon? And the idea was after the first three months of this independent research they would present it all to Dr. Goschel -- who is now my boss, and at that time he was co-mentor on the project -- and they would present their results. We would see where we were going, we would see the first indication of what could be the successive phenomenon to the SUV in America. And so I had these ideas in my head, that this is going to be great. I mean, I'm going to see so much work, it's so intense -- I know probably Las Vegas meant a lot about it, and I'm not really sure where the Grand Canyon came in either -- but somehow all this is going to come together, and I'm going to see some really great product. So we went to Tiburon, after three months, and the team had gotten together the week before, many days ahead of time. The engineers flew over, and designers got together with them, and they put their presentation together. "},{"time":"13:37","text":"Well, it turns out that the engineers hadn't done anything. And they hadn't done anything because -- kind of, like in car business, engineers are there to solve problems, and we were asking them to create a problem. And the engineers were waiting for the designers to say, \"This is the problem that we've created, now help us solve it.\" And they couldn't talk about it. So what happened was, the engineers showed up with nothing. And the engineers told the designers, \"If you go in with all your stuff, we'll walk out, we'll walk right out of the project.\" "},{"time":"14:17","text":"So I didn't know any of this, and we got a presentation that had an agenda, looked like this. There was a whole lot of dialog. We spent four hours being told all about vocabulary that needs to be built between engineers and designers. And here I'm expecting at any moment, \"OK, they're going to turn the page, and I'm going to see the cars, I'm going to see the sketches, I'm going to see maybe some idea of where it's going.\" Dialog kept on going, with mental maps of words, and pretty soon it was becoming obvious that instead of being dazzled with brilliance, I was seriously being baffled with bullshit. And if you can imagine what this is like, to have these months of postcard indication of how great this team is working, and they're out there spending all this money, and they're learning, and they're doing all this stuff. I went fucking ballistic, right? I went nuts. You can probably remember Tiburon, it used to look like this. "},{"time":"15:13","text":"After four hours of this, I stood up, and I took this team apart. I screamed at them, I yelled at them, \"What the hell are you doing? You're letting me down, you're my designers, you're supposed to be the creative ones, what the hell is going on around here?\" It was probably one of my better tirades, I have some good ones, but this was probably one of my better ones. And I went into these people; how could they take BMW's money, how could they have a holiday for three months and produce nothing, nothing? Because of course they didn't tell us that they had three station wagons full of drawings, model concepts, pictures -- everything I wanted, they'd locked up in the cars, because they had shown solidarity with the engineers -- and they'd decided not to show me anything, in order to give the chance for problem solving a chance to start, because they hadn't realized, of course, that they couldn't do problem creating. So we went to lunch -- "},{"time":"16:11","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"16:16","text":"And I've got to tell you, this was one seriously quiet lunch. The engineers all sat at one end of the table, the designers and I sat at the other end of the table, really quiet. And I was just fucking furious, furious. OK? Probably because they had all the fun and I didn't, you know. That's what you get furious about right? And somebody asked me about Catherine, my wife, you know, did she fly out with me or something? I said, \"No,\" and it triggered a set of thoughts about my wife. And I recalled that when Catherine and I were married, the priest gave a very nice sermon, and he said something very important. He said, \"Love is not selfish,\" he said, \"Love does not mean counting how many times I say, 'I love you.' It doesn't mean you had sex this many times this month, and it's two times less than last month, so that means you don't love me as much. Love is not selfish.\" And I thought about this, and I thought, \"You know, I'm not showing love here. I'm seriously not showing love. I'm in the air, I'm in the air without trust. This cannot be. This cannot be that I'm expecting a certain number of sketches, and to me that's my quantification method for qualifying a team. This cannot be.\" "},{"time":"17:35","text":"So I told them this story. I said, \"Guys, I'm thinking about something here, this isn't right. I can't have a relationship with you guys based on a premise that is a quantifiable one. Based on a dictate premise that says, 'I'm a boss, you do what I say, without trust.'\" I said \"This can't be.\" Actually, we all broke down into tears, to be quite honest about it, because they still could not tell me how much frustration they had built up inside of them, not being able to show me what I wanted, and merely having to ask me to trust them that it would come. And I think we felt much closer that day, we cut a lot of strings that didn't need to be there, and we forged the concept for what real team and creativity is all about. We put the car back at the center of our thoughts, and we put love, I think, truly back into the center of the process. "},{"time":"18:34","text":"By the way, that team went on to create six different concepts for the next model of what would be the proposal for the next generation after SUVs in America. One of those was the idea of a crossover coupes -- you see it downstairs, the X Coupe -- they had a lot of fun with that. It was the rendition of our motorcycle, the GS, as Carl Magnusson says, \"brute-iful,\" as the idea of what could be a motorcycle, if you add two more wheels. And so, in conclusion, my lesson that I wanted to pass on to you, was this one here. I'm also going to steal a little quote out of \"Little Prince.\" There's a lot to be said about trust and love, if you know that those two words are synonymous for design. I had a very, very meaningful relationship with my team that day, and it's stayed that way ever since. And I hope that you too find that there's more to design, and more towards the art of the design, than doing it yourself. It's true that the trust and the love, that makes it worthwhile.

(Laughter) "},{"time":"00:16","text":"What I'm going to tell you about in my 18 minutes is how we're about to switch from reading the genetic code to the first stages of beginning to write the code ourselves. It's only 10 years ago this month when we published the first sequence of a free-living organism, that of haemophilus influenzae. That took a genome project from 13 years down to four months. We can now do that same genome project in the order of two to eight hours. So in the last decade, a large number of genomes have been added: most human pathogens, a couple of plants, several insects and several mammals, including the human genome. Genomics at this stage of the thinking from a little over 10 years ago was, by the end of this year, we might have between three and five genomes sequenced; it's on the order of several hundred. We just got a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation to sequence 130 genomes this year, as a side project from environmental organisms. So the rate of reading the genetic code has changed. "},{"time":"01:29","text":"But as we look, what's out there, we've barely scratched the surface on what is available on this planet. Most people don't realize it, because they're invisible, but microbes make up about a half of the Earth's biomass, whereas all animals only make up about one one-thousandth of all the biomass. And maybe it's something that people in Oxford don't do very often, but if you ever make it to the sea, and you swallow a mouthful of seawater, keep in mind that each milliliter has about a million bacteria and on the order of 10 million viruses. "},{"time":"02:04","text":"Less than 5,000 microbial species have been characterized as of two years ago, and so we decided to do something about it. And we started the Sorcerer II Expedition, where we were, as with great oceanographic expeditions, trying to sample the ocean every 200 miles. We started in Bermuda for our test project, then moved up to Halifax, working down the U.S. East Coast, the Caribbean Sea, the Panama Canal, through to the Galapagos, then across the Pacific, and we're in the process now of working our way across the Indian Ocean. It's very tough duty; we're doing this on a sailing vessel, in part to help excite young people about going into science. The experiments are incredibly simple. We just take seawater and we filter it, and we collect different size organisms on different filters, and then take their DNA back to our lab in Rockville, where we can sequence a hundred million letters of the genetic code every 24 hours. And with doing this, we've made some amazing discoveries. "},{"time":"03:08","text":"For example, it was thought that the visual pigments that are in our eyes -- there was only one or two organisms in the environment that had these same pigments. It turns out, almost every species in the upper parts of the ocean in warm parts of the world have these same photoreceptors, and use sunlight as the source of their energy and communication. From one site, from one barrel of seawater, we discovered 1.3 million new genes and as many as 50,000 new species. "},{"time":"03:40","text":"We've extended this to the air now with a grant from the Sloan Foundation. We're measuring how many viruses and bacteria all of us are breathing in and out every day, particularly on airplanes or closed auditoriums. (Laughter) We filter through some simple apparatuses; we collect on the order of a billion microbes from just a day filtering on top of a building in New York City. And we're in the process of sequencing all that at the present time. "},{"time":"04:10","text":"Just on the data collection side, just where we are through the Galapagos, we're finding that almost every 200 miles, we see tremendous diversity in the samples in the ocean. Some of these make logical sense, in terms of different temperature gradients. So this is a satellite photograph based on temperatures -- red being warm, blue being cold -- and we found there's a tremendous difference between the warm water samples and the cold water samples, in terms of abundant species. The other thing that surprised us quite a bit is these photoreceptors detect different wavelengths of light, and we can predict that based on their amino acid sequence. And these vary tremendously from region to region. Maybe not surprisingly, in the deep ocean, where it's mostly blue, the photoreceptors tend to see blue light. When there's a lot of chlorophyll around, they see a lot of green light. But they vary even more, possibly moving towards infrared and ultraviolet in the extremes. "},{"time":"05:15","text":"Just to try and get an assessment of what our gene repertoire was, we assembled all the data -- including all of ours thus far from the expedition, which represents more than half of all the gene data on the planet -- and it totaled around 29 million genes. And we tried to put these into gene families to see what these discoveries are: Are we just discovering new members of known families, or are we discovering new families? And it turns out we have about 50,000 major gene families, but every new sample we take in the environment adds in a linear fashion to these new families. So we're at the earliest stages of discovery about basic genes, components and life on this planet. "},{"time":"06:00","text":"When we look at the so-called evolutionary tree, we're up on the upper right-hand corner with the animals. Of those roughly 29 million genes, we only have around 24,000 in our genome. And if you take all animals together, we probably share less than 30,000 and probably maybe a dozen or more thousand different gene families. I view that these genes are now not only the design components of evolution. And we think in a gene-centric view -- maybe going back to Richard Dawkins' ideas -- than in a genome-centric view, which are different constructs of these gene components. "},{"time":"06:44","text":"Synthetic DNA, the ability to synthesize DNA, has changed at sort of the same pace that DNA sequencing has over the last decade or two, and is getting very rapid and very cheap. Our first thought about synthetic genomics came when we sequenced the second genome back in 1995, and that from mycoplasma genitalium. And we have really nice T-shirts that say, you know, \"I heart my genitalium.\" This is actually just a microorganism. But it has roughly 500 genes. Haemophilus had 1,800 genes. And we simply asked the question, if one species needs 800, another 500, is there a smaller set of genes that might comprise a minimal operating system? "},{"time":"07:29","text":"So we started doing transposon mutagenesis. Transposons are just small pieces of DNA that randomly insert in the genetic code. And if they insert in the middle of the gene, they disrupt its function. So we made a map of all the genes that could take transposon insertions and we called those \"non-essential genes.\" But it turns out the environment is very critical for this, and you can only define an essential or non-essential gene based on exactly what's in the environment. We also tried to take a more directly intellectual approach with the genomes of 13 related organisms, and we tried to compare all of those, to see what they had in common. And we got these overlapping circles. And we found only 173 genes common to all 13 organisms. The pool expanded a little bit if we ignored one intracellular parasite; it expanded even more when we looked at core sets of genes of around 310 or so. So we think that we can expand or contract genomes, depending on your point of view here, to maybe 300 to 400 genes from the minimal of 500. "},{"time":"08:38","text":"The only way to prove these ideas was to construct an artificial chromosome with those genes in them, and we had to do this in a cassette-based fashion. We found that synthesizing accurate DNA in large pieces was extremely difficult. Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison, my colleagues on this, developed an exciting new method that allowed us to synthesize a 5,000-base pair virus in only a two-week period that was 100 percent accurate, in terms of its sequence and its biology. It was a quite exciting experiment -- when we just took the synthetic piece of DNA, injected it in the bacteria and all of a sudden, that DNA started driving the production of the virus particles that turned around and then killed the bacteria. This was not the first synthetic virus -- a polio virus had been made a year before -- but it was only one ten-thousandth as active and it took three years to do. This is a cartoon of the structure of phi X 174. This is a case where the software now builds its own hardware, and that's the notions that we have with biology. "},{"time":"09:45","text":"People immediately jump to concerns about biological warfare, and I had recent testimony before a Senate committee, and a special committee the U.S. government has set up to review this area. And I think it's important to keep reality in mind, versus what happens with people's imaginations. Basically, any virus that's been sequenced today -- that genome can be made. And people immediately freak out about things about Ebola or smallpox, but the DNA from this organism is not infective. So even if somebody made the smallpox genome, that DNA itself would not cause infections. The real concern that security departments have is designer viruses.

For example, from the third organism we sequenced, Methanococcus jannaschii -- it lives in boiling water temperatures; its energy source is hydrogen and all its carbon comes from CO2 it captures back from the environment. So we know lots of different pathways, thousands of different organisms now that live off of CO2, and can capture that back. So instead of using carbon from oil for synthetic processes, we have the chance of using carbon and capturing it back from the atmosphere, converting that into biopolymers or other products. We have one organism that lives off of carbon monoxide, and we use as a reducing power to split water to produce hydrogen and oxygen. Also, there's numerous pathways that can be engineered metabolizing methane. And DuPont has a major program with Statoil in Norway to capture and convert the methane from the gas fields there into useful products.

And this will be my only comment on it. And that is, I understand that optimists greatly outlive pessimists. (Laughter) "},{"time":"00:16","text":"What I'm going to tell you about in my 18 minutes is how we're about to switch from reading the genetic code to the first stages of beginning to write the code ourselves. It's only 10 years ago this month when we published the first sequence of a free-living organism, that of haemophilus influenzae. That took a genome project from 13 years down to four months. We can now do that same genome project in the order of two to eight hours. So in the last decade, a large number of genomes have been added: most human pathogens, a couple of plants, several insects and several mammals, including the human genome. Genomics at this stage of the thinking from a little over 10 years ago was, by the end of this year, we might have between three and five genomes sequenced; it's on the order of several hundred. We just got a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation to sequence 130 genomes this year, as a side project from environmental organisms. So the rate of reading the genetic code has changed. "},{"time":"01:29","text":"But as we look, what's out there, we've barely scratched the surface on what is available on this planet. Most people don't realize it, because they're invisible, but microbes make up about a half of the Earth's biomass, whereas all animals only make up about one one-thousandth of all the biomass. And maybe it's something that people in Oxford don't do very often, but if you ever make it to the sea, and you swallow a mouthful of seawater, keep in mind that each milliliter has about a million bacteria and on the order of 10 million viruses. "},{"time":"02:04","text":"Less than 5,000 microbial species have been characterized as of two years ago, and so we decided to do something about it. And we started the Sorcerer II Expedition, where we were, as with great oceanographic expeditions, trying to sample the ocean every 200 miles. We started in Bermuda for our test project, then moved up to Halifax, working down the U.S. East Coast, the Caribbean Sea, the Panama Canal, through to the Galapagos, then across the Pacific, and we're in the process now of working our way across the Indian Ocean. It's very tough duty; we're doing this on a sailing vessel, in part to help excite young people about going into science. The experiments are incredibly simple. We just take seawater and we filter it, and we collect different size organisms on different filters, and then take their DNA back to our lab in Rockville, where we can sequence a hundred million letters of the genetic code every 24 hours. And with doing this, we've made some amazing discoveries. "},{"time":"03:08","text":"For example, it was thought that the visual pigments that are in our eyes -- there was only one or two organisms in the environment that had these same pigments. It turns out, almost every species in the upper parts of the ocean in warm parts of the world have these same photoreceptors, and use sunlight as the source of their energy and communication. From one site, from one barrel of seawater, we discovered 1.3 million new genes and as many as 50,000 new species. "},{"time":"03:40","text":"We've extended this to the air now with a grant from the Sloan Foundation. We're measuring how many viruses and bacteria all of us are breathing in and out every day, particularly on airplanes or closed auditoriums. (Laughter) We filter through some simple apparatuses; we collect on the order of a billion microbes from just a day filtering on top of a building in New York City. And we're in the process of sequencing all that at the present time. "},{"time":"04:10","text":"Just on the data collection side, just where we are through the Galapagos, we're finding that almost every 200 miles, we see tremendous diversity in the samples in the ocean. Some of these make logical sense, in terms of different temperature gradients. So this is a satellite photograph based on temperatures -- red being warm, blue being cold -- and we found there's a tremendous difference between the warm water samples and the cold water samples, in terms of abundant species. The other thing that surprised us quite a bit is these photoreceptors detect different wavelengths of light, and we can predict that based on their amino acid sequence. And these vary tremendously from region to region. Maybe not surprisingly, in the deep ocean, where it's mostly blue, the photoreceptors tend to see blue light. When there's a lot of chlorophyll around, they see a lot of green light. But they vary even more, possibly moving towards infrared and ultraviolet in the extremes. "},{"time":"05:15","text":"Just to try and get an assessment of what our gene repertoire was, we assembled all the data -- including all of ours thus far from the expedition, which represents more than half of all the gene data on the planet -- and it totaled around 29 million genes. And we tried to put these into gene families to see what these discoveries are: Are we just discovering new members of known families, or are we discovering new families? And it turns out we have about 50,000 major gene families, but every new sample we take in the environment adds in a linear fashion to these new families. So we're at the earliest stages of discovery about basic genes, components and life on this planet. "},{"time":"06:00","text":"When we look at the so-called evolutionary tree, we're up on the upper right-hand corner with the animals. Of those roughly 29 million genes, we only have around 24,000 in our genome. And if you take all animals together, we probably share less than 30,000 and probably maybe a dozen or more thousand different gene families. I view that these genes are now not only the design components of evolution. And we think in a gene-centric view -- maybe going back to Richard Dawkins' ideas -- than in a genome-centric view, which are different constructs of these gene components. "},{"time":"06:44","text":"Synthetic DNA, the ability to synthesize DNA, has changed at sort of the same pace that DNA sequencing has over the last decade or two, and is getting very rapid and very cheap. Our first thought about synthetic genomics came when we sequenced the second genome back in 1995, and that from mycoplasma genitalium. And we have really nice T-shirts that say, you know, \"I heart my genitalium.\" This is actually just a microorganism. But it has roughly 500 genes. Haemophilus had 1,800 genes. And we simply asked the question, if one species needs 800, another 500, is there a smaller set of genes that might comprise a minimal operating system? "},{"time":"07:29","text":"So we started doing transposon mutagenesis. Transposons are just small pieces of DNA that randomly insert in the genetic code. And if they insert in the middle of the gene, they disrupt its function. So we made a map of all the genes that could take transposon insertions and we called those \"non-essential genes.\" But it turns out the environment is very critical for this, and you can only define an essential or non-essential gene based on exactly what's in the environment. We also tried to take a more directly intellectual approach with the genomes of 13 related organisms, and we tried to compare all of those, to see what they had in common. And we got these overlapping circles. And we found only 173 genes common to all 13 organisms. The pool expanded a little bit if we ignored one intracellular parasite; it expanded even more when we looked at core sets of genes of around 310 or so. So we think that we can expand or contract genomes, depending on your point of view here, to maybe 300 to 400 genes from the minimal of 500. "},{"time":"08:38","text":"The only way to prove these ideas was to construct an artificial chromosome with those genes in them, and we had to do this in a cassette-based fashion. We found that synthesizing accurate DNA in large pieces was extremely difficult. Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison, my colleagues on this, developed an exciting new method that allowed us to synthesize a 5,000-base pair virus in only a two-week period that was 100 percent accurate, in terms of its sequence and its biology. It was a quite exciting experiment -- when we just took the synthetic piece of DNA, injected it in the bacteria and all of a sudden, that DNA started driving the production of the virus particles that turned around and then killed the bacteria. This was not the first synthetic virus -- a polio virus had been made a year before -- but it was only one ten-thousandth as active and it took three years to do. This is a cartoon of the structure of phi X 174. This is a case where the software now builds its own hardware, and that's the notions that we have with biology. "},{"time":"09:45","text":"People immediately jump to concerns about biological warfare, and I had recent testimony before a Senate committee, and a special committee the U.S. government has set up to review this area.

Your work is highly sensual, even hedonistic. "},{"time":"03:01","text":"DR: I like that word. "},{"time":"03:03","text":"KA: It's about pleasure -- casinos and hotels and restaurants. How did the shock that all of us -- and especially all of us in New York -- felt on the 11th of September transmute into your desire to do this thing? "},{"time":"03:21","text":"DR: Well the truth of the matter is, post-September 11th, I felt myself in the role originally -- first of all as someone who lives in Tribeca and whose neighborhood was devastated, and as someone who works less than a mile from there -- that I was in the role of forcing 100 people who work with me in my firm, to continue to have the same level of enthusiasm about creating the places we had been creating. In fact we're finishing a book which is called \"Pleasure,\" which is about sensual pleasure in spaces. "},{"time":"03:57","text":"But I've got to tell you -- it became impossible to do that. We were really paralyzed. And I found myself the Friday after September 11th -- two days afterwards -- literally unable to motivate anyone to do anything. We gave the office a few days off. "},{"time":"04:14","text":"And in discussing this with other architects, we had seen people saying in the press that they should rebuild the towers as they were -- they should rebuild them 50 stories taller. And I thought it was astonishing to speculate, as if this were a competition, on something that was such a fresh wound. And I had a series of discussions -- first with Rick Scofidio and Liz Diller, who collaborated with us on this, and several other people -- and really felt like we had to find relevance in doing something. And that as people who create places, the ultimate way to help wasn't to pontificate or to make up scenarios, but to help right now. So we tried to come up with a way, as a group, to have a kind of design SWAT team. And that was the mission that we came up with. "},{"time":"05:11","text":"KA: Were you conscious of suddenly -- as a designer whose work is all about fulfilling wants -- suddenly fulfilling needs? "},{"time":"05:23","text":"DR: Well what I was aware of was, there was this overwhelming need to act now. And we were asked to participate in a few projects before this. There was a school, PS 234, that had been evacuated down at Ground Zero. They moved to an abandoned school. We took about 20 or 30 architects and designers and artists, and over four days -- it was like this urban barn-raising -- to renovate it, and everyone wanted to help. It was just extraordinary. Tom Otterness contributed, Maira Kalman contributed and it became this cathartic experience for us. "},{"time":"06:01","text":"KA: And that was done, effectively, by October 8 or something? "},{"time":"06:05","text":"DR: Yeah. "},{"time":"06:07","text":"KA: Obviously, what you faced in trying to do something as substantial as this project -- and this is only one of four that you've designed to surround the site -- you must have run up against the incredibly byzantine, entrenched bureaucracy and powers that be in New York real estate and New York politics. "},{"time":"06:30","text":"DR: Well, it's a funny thing. We finished PS 234, and had dinner with a small group. I was actually asked to be a committee chair on an AIA committee to rebuild. And I sat in on several meetings. And there were the most circuitous grand plans that had to do with long-term infrastructure and rebuilding the entire city. And the fact is that there were immediate wounds and needs that needed to be filled, and there was talk about inclusion and wanting it to be an inclusive process. And it wasn't an inclusive group. So we said, what is -- "},{"time":"07:03","text":"KA: It was not an inclusive group? "},{"time":"07:05","text":"DR: It was not an inclusive group. It was predominantly a white, rich, corporate group that was not representative of the city. "},{"time":"07:14","text":"KA: Shocking. "},{"time":"07:16","text":"DR: Yeah, surprising. So Rick and Liz and Kevin and I came up with the idea. The city actually approached us. We first approached the city about Pier 94. We saw how PS 234 worked. The families -- the victims of the families -- were going to this pier that was incredibly dehumanizing. "},{"time":"07:36","text":"KA: On the Hudson River? "},{"time":"07:38","text":"DR: Yeah. And the city actually -- through Tim Zagat initially, and then through Christyne Nicholas, then we got to Giuliani -- said, \"You know we don't want to do anything with Pier 94 right now, but we have an observation platform for the families down at Ground Zero that we'd like to be a more dignified experience for the families, and a way to protect it from the weather.\" "},{"time":"07:56","text":"So I went down there with Rick and Liz and Kevin, and I've got to say, it was the most moving experience of my life. It was devastating to see the simple plywood platform with a rail around it, where the families of the victims had left notes to them. And there was no mediation between us and the experience. There was no filter. "},{"time":"08:18","text":"And I remembered on September 11th, on 14th Street, the roof of our building -- we can see the World Trade Towers prominently -- and I saw the first building collapse from a conference room on the eighth floor on a TV that we had set up. And then everyone was up on the roof, so I ran up there. And it was amazing how much harder it was to believe in real life than it was on TV. There was something about the comfort of the filter and how much information was between us and the experience. So seeing this in a very simple, dignified way was a very powerful experience. "},{"time":"08:56","text":"So we went back to the city and said we're not particularly interested in the upgrade of this as a VIP platform, but we've spent some time down there. At the same time the city had this need. They were looking for a solution to deal with 30 or 40 thousand people a day who were going down there, that had nowhere to go. And there was no way to deal with the traffic around the site. So dealing with it is just an immediate master plan. There was a way -- there had to be a way -- to get people to move around the site. "},{"time":"09:28","text":"KA: But then you've got to figure out a way -- we will skip over the insanely tedious process of getting permits and getting everybody on board -- but simply funding this thing. It looks like a fairly simple thing, but this was a half a million dollar project? "},{"time":"09:44","text":"DR: Well, we knew that if it wasn't privately funded, it wasn't going to happen. And we also, frankly, knew that if it didn't happen by the end of the Giuliani administration, then everyone who we were dealing with at the DOT and the Police Department and all of the -- we were meeting with 20 or 30 people with the city at a time, and it was set up by the Office of Emergency Management. This incredible act on their part, because they really wanted this, and they sensed that this needed to happen. "},{"time":"10:10","text":"KA: And there was therefore this ticking clock, because Giuliani was obviously out three months after that. "},{"time":"10:17","text":"DR: Yeah. So the first thing we had to do was find a way to get this -- we had to work with the families of the victims, through the city, to make sure that they knew this was happening. Because this didn't want to be a surprise. And we also had to be as under the radar screen as we could be in New York, because the key was not raising a lot of objection and sort of working as quietly as possible. "},{"time":"10:42","text":"We came up with the idea of setting up a foundation, mainly because when we found a contractor who would build this, he would not agree to do this, even if we would pay him the money. There needed to be a foundation in place. So we came up with a foundation, and actually what happened was one major developer in New York -- "},{"time":"11:04","text":"KA: Who shall remain nameless, I guess? "},{"time":"11:06","text":"DR: Yeah. His initials are JS, and he owns Rockefeller Center, if that helps anyone -- volunteered to help. And we met with him. The prices from the contractors were between five to 700,000 dollars. And Atlantic-Heydt, who's the largest scaffolding contractor in the country, volunteered to do it at cost. So this developer said, \"You know what, we'll underwrite the entire expense.\" And we said, \"That's incredible!\" "},{"time":"11:34","text":"And I think this was the 21st, and we knew this had to be built and up by the 28th. And we had to start construction the next day. We had a meeting that evening with his contractor of choice, and the contractor showed up with the drawings of the platform about half the size that we had drawn it. "},{"time":"11:52","text":"KA: Sort of like the Spinal Tap scene where you get the tiny little Stonehenge, I guess? (Laughter) "},{"time":"12:00","text":"DR: In fact, it was as if this was going to be window-washing scaffolding. There was no sense of the fact that this is next to Saint Paul -- that this is really a place that needs to be kind of dignified, and a place to reflect and remember. And I've got to say that we spent a lot of time in putting this together, watching the crowds that gathered at Saint Paul -- which is just to the right -- and moving around the site. And I live down there, so we spent a lot of time looking at the need. "},{"time":"12:25","text":"And I think people were amazed at two things -- I think they were amazed at the destruction, but I think there was a sense of disbelief about the heroics of New Yorkers that I found very moving. Just the sort of everyday heroics of New Yorkers. "},{"time":"12:41","text":"So we were in this meeting and the contractor literally said, \"I'm going to lock the door, because this developer will not agree to have you leave till you've signed off on this.\" And we said, \"Well, this is half the size, it doesn't have any of the design features that have been agreed upon by everyone -- everyone in the city. We'd have to go back to the beginning to do this.\" And I convinced him that we should leave the room with the agreement to build it as designed. "},{"time":"13:11","text":"The next day I got an email from the developer saying that he was withdrawing all funding. So we didn't know what to do, but we decided to cast a very wide net. We emailed out letters to as many people as we could -- several people in the audience here -- who were very helpful. "},{"time":"13:31","text":"KA: There was no thought of abandoning ship at that point? "},{"time":"13:34","text":"DR: No. In fact I told the contractor to go ahead. He had already ordered materials based on my go-ahead. We knew that one way or another this was going to happen. And we just felt it had to happen. "},{"time":"13:48","text":"KA: You were funding it yourself and with contributions and this foundation. Richard, I think very correctly, made the point at the beginning -- before all the chair designers came out -- about the history of chair designers imposing aesthetic solutions on this kind of universal, banal, common problem of sitting. It seems to me with this, that it was the opposite of that. This was an unprecedented, singular design problem. "},{"time":"14:24","text":"DR: Well here's the issue: we knew that this was not in the sense of -- we think about the site, and think about the need for a memorial. It was important that this not be categorized as a memorial. That this was a place for people to reflect, to remember -- a kind of quiet place. "},{"time":"14:47","text":"So it led us to using design solutions that created as few filters between the viewer -- as we said about the families' platform -- and the experience as possible. It's all incredibly humble material. It's scaffolding and plywood. And it allows -- by sort of the procession of the movement, up by Saint Paul's and down the other side -- it gives you about 300 feet to go up 13 feet from the ground to where you get the 360 degree view. "},{"time":"15:18","text":"But the design was driven by a need to be quick, cheap, safe, respectful, flexible. One of the other things is this is designed to be moveable. Because when we looked at the four platforms around the site, one of which is an upgrade of the families' platform, we knew that these had to be moveable to respond to changing conditions, and the changing definition of what Ground Zero is. "},{"time":"15:46","text":"KA: Your work -- I mean, we've talked about this before -- a lot of your work, I think, is informed by your belief in, or your focus on the temporariness of all things and the evanescence of things, and a kind of \"Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die,\" sort of sense of existence. This is clearly not a work for the ages. You know, a couple of years this thing isn't going to be here. Did that require, as an architect, a new way of thinking about what you were doing? To think of it as this purely temporary installation? "},{"time":"16:25","text":"DR: No, I don't think so. I think this is, obviously, substantially different from anything we'd ever thought about doing before, just by the nature of it. Where it overlaps with thoughts about our work in general is, number one -- the notion of collaboration as a sort of way to get things done. And Kevin Kennon, Rick Scofidio, Liz Diller and all the people within the city -- Norman Lear, who I spoke to four hours before our deadline for funding, offered to give us a bridge loan to help us get through it. So the notion of collaboration -- I think this reinforces how important that is. "},{"time":"17:09","text":"And in terms of the temporary nature of it, our goal was not to create something that would be there longer than it needed to be. I think what we were most interested in was promoting a kind of dialogue that we felt may not have been happening enough in this city, about what's really happening there.

And that's what we were interested in. So that, very much, is in the realm of things I've been interested in before.

And six months after the fact -- and only a few months away from the site being cleaned -- we are very quickly, now, getting to the point where those conversations about what should go there are getting serious. Do you have -- having been as physically involved in the site as you have been doing this project -- have any ideas about what should or shouldn't be done? "},{"time":"18:35","text":"DR: Well, I think one thing that shouldn't be done is evaluate -- I think right now the discussion is a very closed discussion on the master plan.

And I think there should be a broader -- which there's starting to be -- the dialogue is really opening up to, what does this site really want to be? And I truly believe until the issue of memorial is sorted out, that it's going to be very hard to have an intelligent discussion. There's a few discussions right now that I think are very positive, about depressing the West Side Highway and connecting this over, so that there's one uninterrupted piece of land. "},{"time":"19:32","text":"KA: Well, I think that's interesting. And it gets to another issue that was probably inappropriate to discuss six months ago, but perhaps isn't now, which is, not many of us love the World Trade Center as a piece of architecture, as what it had done to this city and that huge plaza. Is this an opportunity, is the silver lining -- a silver lining, here -- to rebuild some more traditional city grid, or not? "},{"time":"19:58","text":"DR: I think there's a real opportunity to engage in a discussion of why we live in cities. And why do we live in places where such dissimilar people collide up against us each day? I don't think it has much to do with 50 or 60 or 70 or 80 thousand new office spaces, regardless of what the number is. So yeah, I think there is a chance to re-look at how we think about cities.

This morning, the world's experts from I guess three or four different companies on building seats, I think concluded that ultimately, the solution is, people shouldn't sit down. I could have told them that. (Laughter) Yesterday, the automotive guys gave us some new insights. They pointed out that, I believe it was between 30 and 50 years from today, they will be steering cars by wire, without all that mechanical stuff. (Laughter) That's reassuring. (Applause) They then pointed out that there'd be, sort of, the other controls by wire, to get rid of all that mechanical stuff. That's pretty good, but why not get rid of the wires? Then you don't need anything to control the car, except thinking about it. I would love to talk about the technology, and sometime, in what's past the 15 minutes, I'll be happy to talk to all the techno-geeks around here about what's in here. But if I had one thing to say about this, before we get to first, it would be that from the time we started building this, the big idea wasn't the technology. It really was a big idea in technology when we started applying it in the iBOT for the disabled community. The big idea here is, I think, a new piece of a solution to a fairly big problem in transportation. And maybe to put that in perspective: there's so much data on this, I'll be happy to give it to you in different forms. You never know what strikes the fancy of whom, but everybody is perfectly willing to believe the car changed the world. And Henry Ford, just about 100 years ago, started cranking out Model Ts. What I don't think most people think about is the context of how technology is applied. For instance, in that time, 91 percent of America lived either on farms or in small towns. So, the car -- the horseless carriage that replaced the horse and carriage -- was a big deal; it went twice as fast as a horse and carriage. It was half as long. And it was an environmental improvement, because, for instance, in 1903 they outlawed horses and buggies in downtown Manhattan, because you can imagine what the roads look like when you have a million horses, and a million of them urinating and doing other things, and the typhoid and other problems created were almost unimaginable. So the car was the clean environmental alternative to a horse and buggy. It also was a way for people to get from their farm to a farm, or their farm to a town, or from a town to a city. It all made sense, with 91 percent of the people living there. By the 1950s, we started connecting all the towns together with what a lot of people claim is the eighth wonder of the world, the highway system. And it is certainly a wonder. And by the way, as I take shots at old technologies, I want to assure everybody, and particularly the automotive industry -- who's been very supportive of us -- that I don't think this in any way competes with airplanes, or cars. But think about where the world is today. 50 percent of the global population now lives in cities. That's 3.2 billion people. We've solved all the transportation problems that have changed the world to get it to where we are today. 500 years ago, sailing ships started getting reliable enough; we found a new continent. 150 years ago, locomotives got efficient enough, steam power, that we turned the continent into a country. Over the last hundred years, we started building cars, and then over the 50 years we've connected every city to every other city in an extraordinarily efficient way, and we have a very high standard of living as a consequence of that. But during that entire process, more and more people have been born, and more and more people are moving to cities. China alone is going to move four to six hundred million people into cities in the next decade and a half. And so, nobody, I think, would argue that airplanes, in the last 50 years, have turned the continent and the country now into a neighborhood. And if you just look at how technology has been applied, we've solved all the long-range, high-speed, high-volume, large-weight problems of moving things around. Nobody would want to give them up. And I certainly wouldn't want to give up my airplane, or my helicopter, or my Humvee, or my Porsche. I love them all. I don't keep any of them in my living room. The fact is, the last mile is the problem, and half the world now lives in dense cities. And people spend, depending on who they are, between 90 and 95 percent of their energy getting around on foot. I think there's -- I don't know what data would impress you, but how about, 43 percent of the refined fuel produced in the world is consumed by cars in metropolitan areas in the United States. Three million people die every year in cities due to bad air, and almost all particulate pollution on this planet is produced by transportation devices, particularly sitting in cities. And again, I say that not to attack any industry, I think -- I really do -- I love my airplane, and cars on highways moving 60 miles an hour are extraordinarily efficient, both from an engineering point of view, an energy consumption point of view, and a utility point of view. And we all love our cars, and I do. The problem is, you get into the city and you want to go four blocks, it's neither fun nor efficient nor productive. It's not sustainable. If -- in China, in the year 1998, 417 million people used bicycles; 1.7 million people used cars. If five percent of that population became, quote, middle class, and wanted to go the way we've gone in the last hundred years at the same time that 50 percent of their population are moving into cities of the size and density of Manhattan, every six weeks -- it isn't sustainable environmentally; it isn't sustainable economically -- there just ain't enough oil -- and it's not sustainable politically. I mean, what are we fighting over right now? We can make it complicated, but what's the world fighting over right now? So it seemed to me that somebody had to work on that last mile, and it was dumb luck. We were working on iBOTs, but once we made this, we instantly decided it could be a great alternative to jet skis. You don't need the water. Or snowmobiles. You don't need the snow. Or skiing. It's just fun, and people love to move around doing fun things. And every one of those industries, by the way -- just golf carts alone is a multi-billion-dollar industry. But rather than go license this off, which is what we normally do, it seemed to me that if we put all our effort not into the technology, but into an understanding of a world that's solved all its other problems, but has somehow come to accept that cities -- which, right back from ancient Greece on, were meant to walk around, cities that were architected and built for people -- now have a footprint that, while we've solved every other transportation problem -- and it's like Moore's law. I mean, look at the time it took to cross a continent in a Conestoga wagon, then on a railroad, then an airplane. Every other form of transportation's been improved. In 5,000 years, we've gone backwards in getting around cities. They've gotten bigger; they're spread out. The most expensive real estate on this planet in every city -- Wilshire Boulevard, or Fifth Avenue, or Tokyo, or Paris -- the most expensive real estate is their downtowns. 65 percent of the landmass of our cities are parked cars. The 20 largest cities in the world. So you wonder, what if cities could give to their pedestrians what we take for granted as we now go between cities? What if you could make them fun, attractive, clean, environmentally friendly? What if it would make it a little bit more palatable to have access via this, as that last link to mass transit, to get out to your cars so we can all live in the suburbs and use our cars the way we want, and then have our cities energized again? We thought it would be really neat to do that, and one of the problems we really were worried about is: how do we get legal on the sidewalk? Because technically I've got motors; I've got wheels -- I'm a motor vehicle. I don't look like a motor vehicle. I have the same footprint as a pedestrian; I have the same unique capability to deal with other pedestrians in a crowded space. I took this down to Ground Zero, and knocked my way through crowds for an hour. I'm a pedestrian. But the law typically lags technology by a generation or two, and if we get told we don't belong on the sidewalk, we have two choices. We're a recreational vehicle that doesn't really matter, and I don't spend my time doing that kind of stuff. Or maybe we should be out in the street in front of a Greyhound bus or a vehicle. We've been so concerned about that, we went to the Postmaster General of the United States, as the first person we ever showed on the outside, and said, \"Put your people on it. Everybody trusts their postman. And they belong on the sidewalks, and they'll use it seriously.\" He agreed. We went to a number of police departments that want their police officers back in the neighborhood on the beat, carrying 70 pounds of stuff. They love it. And I can't believe a policeman is going to give themselves a ticket. (Laughter) So we've been working really, really hard, but we knew that the technology would not be as hard to develop as an attitude about what's important, and how to apply the technology. We went out and we found some visionary people with enough money to let us design and build these things, and in hopefully enough time to get them accepted. So, I'm happy, really, I am happy to talk about this technology as much as you want. And yes, it's really fun, and yes, you should all go out and try it. But if I could ask you to do one thing, it's not to think about it as a piece of technology, but just imagine that, although we all understand somehow that it's reasonable that we use our 4,000-pound machine, which can go 60 miles an hour, that can bring you everywhere you want to go, and somehow it's also what we used for the last mile, and it's broken, and it doesn't work. One of the more exciting things that occurred to us about why it might get accepted, happened out here in California. A few weeks ago, after we launched it, we were here with a news crew on Venice Beach, zipping up and back, and he's marveling at the technology, and meanwhile bicycles are zipping by, and skateboarders are zipping by, and a little old lady -- I mean, if you looked in the dictionary, a little old lady -- came by me -- and now that I'm on this, I'm the height of a normal adult now -- and she just stops, and the camera is there, and she looks up at me and says, \"Can I try that?\" And what was I -- you know, how are you going to say anything? And so I said, \"Sure.\" So I get off, and she gets on, and with a little bit of the usual, ah, then she turns around, and she goes about 20 feet, and she turns back around, and she's all smiles. And she comes back to me and she stops, and she says, \"Finally, they made something for us.\" And the camera is looking down at her. I'm thinking, \"Wow, that was great -- (Laughter) -- please lady, don't say another word.\" (Laughter) And the camera is down at her, and this guy has to put the microphone in her face, said, \"What do you mean by that?\" And I figured, \"It's all over now,\" and she looks up and she says, \"Well,\" she's still watching these guys go; she says, \"I can't ride a bike,\" no, she says, \"I can't use a skateboard, and I've never used roller blades,\" she knew them by name; she says, \"And it's been 50 years since I rode a bicycle.\" Then she looks up, she's looking up, and she says, \"And I'm 81 years old, and I don't drive a car anymore. I still have to get to the store, and I can't carry a lot of things.\" And it suddenly occurred to me, that among my many fears, were not just that the bureaucracy and the regulators and the legislators might not get it -- it was that, fundamentally, you believe there's pressure among the people not to invade the most precious little bit of space left, the sidewalks in these cities. When you look at the 36 inches of legal requirement for sidewalk, then the eight foot for the parked car, then the three lanes, and then the other eight feet -- it's -- that little piece is all that's there. But she looks up and says this, and it occurs to me, well, kids aren't going to mind these things, and they don't vote, and business people and then young adults aren't going to mind these things -- they're pretty cool -- so I guess subliminally I was worried that it's the older population that's going to worry. So, having seen this, and having worried about it for eight years, the first thing I do is pick up my phone and ask our marketing and regulatory guys, call AARP, get an appointment right away. We've got to show them this thing. And they took it to Washington; they showed them; and they're going to be involved now, watching how these things get absorbed in a number of cities, like Atlanta, where we're doing trials to see if it really can, in fact, help re-energize their downtown. (Applause) The bottom line is, whether you believe the United Nations, or any of the other think tanks -- in the next 20 years, all human population growth on this planet will be in cities. In Asia alone, it will be over a billion people. They learned to start with cell phones. They didn't have to take the 100-year trip we took. They start at the top of the technology food chain. We've got to start building cities and human environments where a 150-pound person can go a couple of miles in a dense, rich, green-space environment, without being in a 4,000-pound machine to do it. Cars were not meant for parallel parking; they're wonderful machines to go between cities, but just think about it: we've solved all the long-range, high-speed problems. The Greeks went from the theater of Dionysus to the Parthenon in their sandals. You do it in your sneakers. Not much has changed. If this thing goes only three times as fast as walking -- three times -- a 30-minute walk becomes 10 minutes. Your choice, when living in a city, if it's now 10 minutes -- because at 30 minutes you want an alternative, whether it's a bus, a train -- we've got to build an infrastructure -- a light rail -- or you're going to keep parking those cars. But if you could put a pin in most cities, and imagine how far you could, if you had the time, walk in one half-hour, it's the city. If you could make it fun, and make it eight or 10 minutes, you can't find your car, un-park your car, move your car, re-park your car and go somewhere; you can't get to a cab or a subway. We could change the way people allocate their resources, the way this planet uses its energy, make it more fun. And we're hoping to some extent history will say we were right. That's Segway. This is a Stirling cycle engine; this had been confused by a lot of things we're doing. This little beast, right now, is producing a few hundred watts of electricity. Yes, it could be attached to this, and yes, on a kilogram of propane, you could drive from New York to Boston if you so choose. Perhaps more interesting about this little engine is it'll burn any fuel, because some of you might be skeptical about the capability of this to have an impact, where most of the world you can't simply plug into your 120-volt outlet. We've been working on this, actually, as an alternative energy source, starting way back with Johnson &amp; Johnson, to run an iBOT, because the best batteries you could get -- 10 watt-hours per kilogram in lead, 20 watt-hours per kilogram nickel-cadmium, 40 watt-hours per kilogram in nickel-metal hydride, 60 watt-hours per kilogram in lithium, 8,750 watt-hours of energy in every kilogram of propane or gasoline -- which is why nobody drives electric cars. But, in any event, if you can burn it with the same efficiency -- because it's external combustion -- as your kitchen stove, if you can burn any fuel, it turns out to be pretty neat. It makes just enough electricity to, for instance, do this, which at night is enough electricity, in the rest of the world, as Mr. Holly -- Dr. Holly -- pointed out, can run computers and a light bulb. But more interestingly, the thermodynamics of this say, you're never going to get more than 20 percent efficiency. It doesn't matter much -- it says if you get 200 watts of electricity, you'll get 700 or 800 watts of heat. If you wanted to boil water and re-condense it at a rate of 10 gallons an hour, it takes about 25, a little over 25.3 kilowatt -- 25,000 watts of continuous power -- to do it. That's so much energy, you couldn't afford to desalinate or clean water in this country that way. Certainly, in the rest of the world, your choice is to devastate the place, turning everything that will burn into heat, or drink the water that's available. The number one cause of death on this planet among humans is bad water. Depending on whose numbers you believe, it's between 60 and 85,000 people per day. We don't need sophisticated heart transplants around the world. We need water. And women shouldn't have to spend four hours a day looking for it, or watching their kids die. We figured out how to put a vapor-compression distiller on this thing, with a counter-flow heat exchanger to take the waste heat, then using a little bit of the electricity control that process, and for 450 watts, which is a little more than half of its waste heat, it will make 10 gallons an hour of distilled water from anything that comes into it to cool it. So if we put this box on here in a few years, could we have a solution to transportation, electricity, and communication, and maybe drinkable water in a sustainable package that weighs 60 pounds? I don't know, but we'll try it. I better shut up.

First of all, it's been fantastic being here over these past few days. And secondly, I feel it's a great honor to kind of wind up this extraordinary gathering of people, these amazing talks that we've had. I feel that I've fitted in, in many ways, to some of the things that I've heard. I came directly here from the deep, deep tropical rainforest in Ecuador, where I was out -- you could only get there by a plane -- with indigenous people with paint on their faces and parrot feathers on their headdresses, where these people are fighting to try and keep the oil companies, and keep the roads, out of their forests. They're fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest in a world that's clean, a world that isn't contaminated, a world that isn't polluted. And what was so amazing to me, and what fits right in with what we're all talking about here at TED, is that there, right in the middle of this rainforest, was some solar panels -- the first in that part of Ecuador -- and that was mainly to bring water up by pump so that the women wouldn't have to go down. The water was cleaned, but because they got a lot of batteries, they were able to store a lot of electricity. So every house -- and there were, I think, eight houses in this little community -- could have light for, I think it was about half an hour each evening. And there is the Chief, in all his regal finery, with a laptop computer. (Laughter) And this man, he has been outside, but he's gone back, and he was saying, \"You know, we have suddenly jumped into a whole new era, and we didn't even know about the white man 50 years ago, and now here we are with laptop computers, and there are some things we want to learn from the modern world. We want to know about health care. We want to know about what other people do -- we're interested in it. And we want to learn other languages. We want to know English and French and perhaps Chinese, and we're good at languages.\" So there he is with his little laptop computer, but fighting against the might of the pressures -- because of the debt, the foreign debt of Ecuador -- fighting the pressure of World Bank, IMF, and of course the people who want to exploit the forests and take out the oil. And so, coming directly from there to here. But, of course, my real field of expertise lies in an even different kind of civilization -- I can't really call it a civilization. A different way of life, a different being. We've talked earlier -- this wonderful talk by Wade Davis about the different cultures of the humans around the world -- but the world is not composed only of human beings; there are also other animal beings. And I propose to bring into this TED conference, as I always do around the world, the voice of the animal kingdom. Too often we just see a few slides, or a bit of film, but these beings have voices that mean something. And so, I want to give you a greeting, as from a chimpanzee in the forests of Tanzania -- Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh! (Applause) I've been studying chimpanzees in Tanzania since 1960. During that time, there have been modern technologies that have really transformed the way that field biologists do their work. For example, for the first time, a few years ago, by simply collecting little fecal samples we were able to have them analyzed -- to have DNA profiling done -- so for the first time, we actually know which male chimps are the fathers of each individual infant. Because the chimps have a very promiscuous mating society. So this opens up a whole new avenue of research. And we use GSI -- geographic whatever it is, GSI -- to determine the range of the chimps. And we're using -- you can see that I'm not really into this kind of stuff -- but we're using satellite imagery to look at the deforestation in the area. And of course, there's developments in infrared, so you can watch animals at night, and equipment for recording by video, and tape recording is getting lighter and better. So in many, many ways, we can do things today that we couldn't do when I began in 1960. Especially when chimpanzees, and other animals with large brains, are studied in captivity, modern technology is helping us to search for the upper levels of cognition in some of these non-human animals. So that we know today, they're capable of performances that would have been thought absolutely impossible by science when I began. I think the chimpanzee in captivity who is the most skilled in intellectual performance is one called Ai in Japan -- her name means love -- and she has a wonderfully sensitive partner working with her. She loves her computer -- she'll leave her big group, and her running water, and her trees and everything. And she'll come in to sit at this computer -- it's like a video game for a kid; she's hooked. She's 28, by the way, and she does things with her computer screen and a touch pad that she can do faster than most humans. She does very complex tasks, and I haven't got time to go into them, but the amazing thing about this female is she doesn't like making mistakes. If she has a bad run, and her score isn't good, she'll come and reach up and tap on the glass -- because she can't see the experimenter -- which is asking to have another go. And her concentration -- she's already concentrated hard for 20 minutes or so, and now she wants to do it all over again, just for the satisfaction of having done it better. And the food is not important -- she does get a tiny reward, like one raisin for a correct response -- but she will do it for nothing, if you tell her beforehand. So here we are, a chimpanzee using a computer. Chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans also learn human sign language. But the point is that when I was first in Gombe in 1960 -- I remember so well, so vividly, as though it was yesterday -- the first time, when I was going through the vegetation, the chimpanzees were still running away from me, for the most part, although some were a little bit acclimatized -- and I saw this dark shape, hunched over a termite mound, and I peered with my binoculars. It was, fortunately, one adult male whom I'd named David Greybeard -- and by the way, science at that time was telling me that I shouldn't name the chimps; they should all have numbers; that was more scientific. Anyway, David Greybeard -- and I saw that he was picking little pieces of grass and using them to fish termites from their underground nest. And not only that -- he would sometimes pick a leafy twig and strip the leaves -- modifying an object to make it suitable for a specific purpose -- the beginning of tool-making. The reason this was so exciting and such a breakthrough is at that time, it was thought that humans, and only humans, used and made tools. When I was at school, we were defined as man, the toolmaker. So that when Louis Leakey, my mentor, heard this news, he said, \"Ah, we must now redefine 'man,' redefine 'tool,' or accept chimpanzees as humans.\" (Laughter) We now know that at Gombe alone, there are nine different ways in which chimpanzees use different objects for different purposes. Moreover, we know that in different parts of Africa, wherever chimps have been studied, there are completely different tool-using behaviors. And because it seems that these patterns are passed from one generation to the next, through observation, imitation and practice -- that is a definition of human culture. What we find is that over these 40-odd years that I and others have been studying chimpanzees and the other great apes, and, as I say, other mammals with complex brains and social systems, we have found that after all, there isn't a sharp line dividing humans from the rest of the animal kingdom. It's a very wuzzy line. It's getting wuzzier all the time as we find animals doing things that we, in our arrogance, used to think was just human. The chimps -- there's no time to discuss their fascinating lives -- but they have this long childhood, five years of suckling and sleeping with the mother, and then another three, four or five years of emotional dependence on her, even when the next child is born. The importance of learning in that time, when behavior is flexible -- and there's an awful lot to learn in chimpanzee society. The long-term affectionate supportive bonds that develop throughout this long childhood with the mother, with the brothers and sisters, and which can last through a lifetime, which may be up to 60 years. They can actually live longer than 60 in captivity, so we've only done 40 years in the wild so far. And we find chimps are capable of true compassion and altruism. We find in their non-verbal communication -- this is very rich -- they have a lot of sounds, which they use in different circumstances, but they also use touch, posture, gesture, and what do they do? They kiss; they embrace; they hold hands. They pat one another on the back; they swagger; they shake their fist -- the kind of things that we do, and they do them in the same kind of context. They have very sophisticated cooperation. Sometimes they hunt -- not that often, but when they hunt, they show sophisticated cooperation, and they share the prey. We find that they show emotions, similar to -- maybe sometimes the same -- as those that we describe in ourselves as happiness, sadness, fear, despair. They know mental as well as physical suffering. And I don't have time to go into the information that will prove some of these things to you, save to say that there are very bright students, in the best universities, studying emotions in animals, studying personalities in animals. We know that chimpanzees and some other creatures can recognize themselves in mirrors -- \"self\" as opposed to \"other.\" They have a sense of humor, and these are the kind of things which traditionally have been thought of as human prerogatives. But this teaches us a new respect -- and it's a new respect not only for the chimpanzees, I suggest, but some of the other amazing animals with whom we share this planet. Once we're prepared to admit that after all, we're not the only beings with personalities, minds and above all feelings, and then we start to think about ways we use and abuse so many other sentient, sapient creatures on this planet, it really gives cause for deep shame, at least for me. So, the sad thing is that these chimpanzees -- who've perhaps taught us, more than any other creature, a little humility -- are in the wild, disappearing very fast. They're disappearing for the reasons that all of you in this room know only too well. The deforestation, the growth of human populations, needing more land. They're disappearing because some timber companies go in with clear-cutting. They're disappearing in the heart of their range in Africa because the big multinational logging companies have come in and made roads -- as they want to do in Ecuador and other parts where the forests remain untouched -- to take out oil or timber. And this has led in Congo basin, and other parts of the world, to what is known as the bush-meat trade. This means that although for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years, people have lived in those forests, or whatever habitat it is, in harmony with their world, just killing the animals they need for themselves and their families -- now, suddenly, because of the roads, the hunters can go in from the towns. They shoot everything, every single thing that moves that's bigger than a small rat; they sun-dry it or smoke it. And now they've got transport; they take it on the logging trucks or the mining trucks into the towns where they sell it. And people will pay more for bush-meat, as it's called, than for domestic meat -- it's culturally preferred. And it's not sustainable, and the huge logging camps in the forest are now demanding meat, so the Pygmy hunters in the Congo basin who've lived there with their wonderful way of living for so many hundreds of years are now corrupted. They're given weapons; they shoot for the logging camps; they get money. Their culture is being destroyed, along with the animals upon whom they depend. So, when the logging camp moves, there's nothing left. We talked already about the loss of human cultural diversity, and I've seen it happening with my own eyes. And the grim picture in Africa -- I love Africa, and what do we see in Africa? We see deforestation; we see the desert spreading; we see massive hunger; we see disease and we see population growth in areas where there are more people living on a certain piece of land than the land can possibly support, and they're too poor to buy food from elsewhere. Were the people that we heard about yesterday, on the Easter Island, who cut down their last tree -- were they stupid? Didn't they know what was happening? Of course, but if you've seen the crippling poverty in some of these parts of the world it isn't a question of \"Let's leave the tree for tomorrow.\" \"How am I going to feed my family today? Maybe I can get just a few dollars from this last tree which will keep us going a little bit longer, and then we'll pray that something will happen to save us from the inevitable end.\" So, this is a pretty grim picture. The one thing we have, which makes us so different from chimpanzees or other living creatures, is this sophisticated spoken language -- a language with which we can tell children about things that aren't here. We can talk about the distant past, plan for the distant future, discuss ideas with each other, so that the ideas can grow from the accumulated wisdom of a group. We can do it by talking to each other; we can do it through video; we can do it through the written word. And we are abusing this great power we have to be wise stewards, and we're destroying the world. In the developed world, in a way, it's worse, because we have so much access to knowledge of the stupidity of what we're doing. Do you know, we're bringing little babies into a world where, in many places, the water is poisoning them? And the air is harming them, and the food that's grown from the contaminated land is poisoning them. And that's not just in the far-away developing world; that's everywhere. Do you know we all have about 50 chemicals in our bodies we didn't have about 50 years ago? And so many of these diseases, like asthma and certain kinds of cancers, are on the increase around places where our filthy toxic waste is dumped. We're harming ourselves around the world, as well as harming the animals, as well as harming nature herself -- Mother Nature, that brought us into being; Mother Nature, where I believe we need to spend time, where there's trees and flowers and birds for our good psychological development. And yet, there are hundreds and hundreds of children in the developed world who never see nature, because they're growing up in concrete and all they know is virtual reality, with no opportunity to go and lie in the sun, or in the forest, with the dappled sun-specks coming down from the canopy above. As I was traveling around the world, you know, I had to leave the forest -- that's where I love to be. I had to leave these fascinating chimpanzees for my students and field staff to continue studying because, finding they dwindled from about two million 100 years ago to about 150,000 now, I knew I had to leave the forest to do what I could to raise awareness around the world. And the more I talked about the chimpanzees' plight, the more I realized the fact that everything's interconnected, and the problems of the developing world so often stem from the greed of the developed world, and everything was joining together, and making -- not sense, hope lies in sense, you said -- it's making a nonsense. How can we do it? Somebody said that yesterday. And as I was traveling around, I kept meeting young people who'd lost hope. They were feeling despair, they were feeling, \"Well, it doesn't matter what we do; eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die. Everything is hopeless -- we're always being told so by the media.\" And then I met some who were angry, and anger that can turn to violence, and we're all familiar with that. And I have three little grandchildren, and when some of these students would say to me at high school or university, they'd say, \"We're angry,\" or \"We're filled with despair, because we feel you've compromised our future, and there's nothing we can do about it.\" And I looked in the eyes of my little grandchildren, and think how much we've harmed this planet since I was their age. I feel this deep shame, and that's why in 1991 in Tanzania, I started a program that's called Roots and Shoots. There's little brochures all around outside, and if any of you have anything to do with children and care about their future, I beg that you pick up that brochure. And Roots and Shoots is a program for hope. Roots make a firm foundation. Shoots seem tiny, but to reach the sun they can break through brick walls. See the brick walls as all the problems that we've inflicted on this planet. Then, you see, it is a message of hope. Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world can break through, and can make this a better world. And the most important message of Roots and Shoots is that every single individual makes a difference. Every individual has a role to play. Every one of us impacts the world around us everyday, and you scientists know that you can't actually -- even if you stay in bed all day, you're breathing oxygen and giving out CO2, and probably going to the loo, and things like that -- you're making a difference in the world. So, the Roots and Shoots program involves youth in three kinds of projects. And these are projects to make the world around them a better place. One project to show care and concern for your own human community. One for animals, including domestic animals -- and I have to say, I learned everything I know about animal behavior even before I got to Gombe and the chimps from my dog, Rusty, who was my childhood companion. And the third kind of project: something for the local environment. So what the kids do depends first of all, how old are they -- and we go now from pre-school right through university. It's going to depend whether they're inner-city or rural. It's going to depend if they're wealthy or impoverished. It's going to depend which part, say, of America they're in. We're in every state now, and the problems in Florida are different from the problems in New York. It's going to depend on which country they're in -- and we're already in 60-plus countries, with about 5,000 active groups -- and there are groups all over the place that I keep hearing about that I've never even heard of, because the kids are taking the program and spreading it themselves. Why? Because they're buying into it, and they're the ones who get to decide what they're going to do. It isn't something that their parents tell them, or their teachers tell them. That's effective, but if they decide themselves, \"We want to clean this river and put the fish back that used to be there. We want to clear away the toxic soil from this area and have an organic garden. We want to go and spend time with the old people and hear their stories and record their oral histories. We want to go and work in a dog shelter. We want to learn about animals. We want ... \" You know, it goes on and on, and this is very hopeful for me. As I travel around the world 300 days a year, everywhere there's a group of Roots and Shoots of different ages. Everywhere there are children with shining eyes saying, \"Look at the difference we've made.\" And now comes the technology into it, because with this new way of communicating electronically these kids can communicate with each other around the world. And if anyone is interested to help us, we've got so many ideas but we need help -- we need help to create the right kind of system that will help these young people to communicate their excitement. But also -- and this is so important -- to communicate their despair, to say, \"We've tried this and it doesn't work, and what shall we do?\" And then, lo and behold, there's another group answering these kids who may be in America, or maybe this is a group in Israel, saying, \"Yeah, you did it a little bit wrong. This is how you should do it.\" The philosophy is very simple. We do not believe in violence. No violence, no bombs, no guns. That's not the way to solve problems. Violence leads to violence, at least in my view. So how do we solve? The tools for solving the problems are knowledge and understanding. Know the facts, but see how they fit in the big picture. Hard work and persistence --don't give up -- and love and compassion leading to respect for all life. How many more minutes? Two, one? Chris Anderson: One -- one to two. Jane Goodall: Two, two, I'm going to take two. (Laughter) Are you going to come and drag me off? (Laughter) Anyway -- so basically, Roots and Shoots is beginning to change young people's lives. It's what I'm devoting most of my energy to. And I believe that a group like this can have a very major impact, not just because you can share technology with us, but because so many of you have children. And if you take this program out, and give it to your children, they have such a good opportunity to go out and do good, because they've got parents like you. And it's been so clear how much you all care about trying to make this world a better place. It's very encouraging. But the kids do ask me -- and this won't take more than two minutes, I promise -- the kids say, \"Dr. Jane, do you really have hope for the future? You travel, you see all these horrible things happening.\" Firstly, the human brain -- I don't need to say anything about that. Now that we know what the problems are around the world, human brains like yours are rising to solve those problems. And we've talked a lot about that. Secondly, the resilience of nature. We can destroy a river, and we can bring it back to life. We can see a whole area desolated, and it can be brought back to bloom again, with time or a little help. And thirdly, the last speaker talked about -- or the speaker before last, talked about the indomitable human spirit. We are surrounded by the most amazing people who do things that seem to be absolutely impossible. Nelson Mandela -- I take a little piece of limestone from Robben Island Prison, where he labored for 27 years, and came out with so little bitterness, he could lead his people from the horror of apartheid without a bloodbath. Even after the 11th of September -- and I was in New York and I felt the fear -- nevertheless, there was so much human courage, so much love and so much compassion. And then as I went around the country after that and felt the fear -- the fear that was leading to people feeling they couldn't worry about the environment any more, in case they seemed not to be patriotic -- and I was trying to encourage them, somebody came up with a little quotation from Mahatma Gandhi, \"If you look back through human history, you see that every evil regime has been overcome by good.\" And just after that a woman brought me this little bell, and I want to end on this note. She said, \"If you're talking about hope and peace, ring this. This bell is made from metal from a defused landmine, from the killing fields of Pol Pot -- one of the most evil regimes in human history -- where people are now beginning to put their lives back together after the regime has crumbled. So, yes, there is hope, and where is the hope? Is it out there with the politicians? It's in our hands. It's in your hands and my hands and those of our children. It's really up to us. We're the ones who can make a difference. If we lead lives where we consciously leave the lightest possible ecological footprints, if we buy the things that are ethical for us to buy and don't buy the things that are not, we can change the world overnight. Thank you.

First of all, it's been fantastic being here over these past few days. And secondly, I feel it's a great honor to kind of wind up this extraordinary gathering of people, these amazing talks that we've had. I feel that I've fitted in, in many ways, to some of the things that I've heard. I came directly here from the deep, deep tropical rainforest in Ecuador, where I was out -- you could only get there by a plane -- with indigenous people with paint on their faces and parrot feathers on their headdresses, where these people are fighting to try and keep the oil companies, and keep the roads, out of their forests. They're fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest in a world that's clean, a world that isn't contaminated, a world that isn't polluted. And what was so amazing to me, and what fits right in with what we're all talking about here at TED, is that there, right in the middle of this rainforest, was some solar panels -- the first in that part of Ecuador -- and that was mainly to bring water up by pump so that the women wouldn't have to go down. The water was cleaned, but because they got a lot of batteries, they were able to store a lot of electricity. So every house -- and there were, I think, eight houses in this little community -- could have light for, I think it was about half an hour each evening. And there is the Chief, in all his regal finery, with a laptop computer. (Laughter) And this man, he has been outside, but he's gone back, and he was saying, \"You know, we have suddenly jumped into a whole new era, and we didn't even know about the white man 50 years ago, and now here we are with laptop computers, and there are some things we want to learn from the modern world. We want to know about health care. We want to know about what other people do -- we're interested in it. And we want to learn other languages. We want to know English and French and perhaps Chinese, and we're good at languages.\" So there he is with his little laptop computer, but fighting against the might of the pressures -- because of the debt, the foreign debt of Ecuador -- fighting the pressure of World Bank, IMF, and of course the people who want to exploit the forests and take out the oil. And so, coming directly from there to here. But, of course, my real field of expertise lies in an even different kind of civilization -- I can't really call it a civilization. A different way of life, a different being. We've talked earlier -- this wonderful talk by Wade Davis about the different cultures of the humans around the world -- but the world is not composed only of human beings; there are also other animal beings. And I propose to bring into this TED conference, as I always do around the world, the voice of the animal kingdom. Too often we just see a few slides, or a bit of film, but these beings have voices that mean something. And so, I want to give you a greeting, as from a chimpanzee in the forests of Tanzania -- Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh! (Applause) I've been studying chimpanzees in Tanzania since 1960. During that time, there have been modern technologies that have really transformed the way that field biologists do their work.

Maybe I can get just a few dollars from this last tree which will keep us going a little bit longer, and then we'll pray that something will happen to save us from the inevitable end.\" So, this is a pretty grim picture. The one thing we have, which makes us so different from chimpanzees or other living creatures, is this sophisticated spoken language -- a language with which we can tell children about things that aren't here. We can talk about the distant past, plan for the distant future, discuss ideas with each other, so that the ideas can grow from the accumulated wisdom of a group. We can do it by talking to each other; we can do it through video; we can do it through the written word. And we are abusing this great power we have to be wise stewards, and we're destroying the world. In the developed world, in a way, it's worse, because we have so much access to knowledge of the stupidity of what we're doing. Do you know, we're bringing little babies into a world where, in many places, the water is poisoning them? And the air is harming them, and the food that's grown from the contaminated land is poisoning them. And that's not just in the far-away developing world; that's everywhere. Do you know we all have about 50 chemicals in our bodies we didn't have about 50 years ago? And so many of these diseases, like asthma and certain kinds of cancers, are on the increase around places where our filthy toxic waste is dumped. We're harming ourselves around the world, as well as harming the animals, as well as harming nature herself -- Mother Nature, that brought us into being; Mother Nature, where I believe we need to spend time, where there's trees and flowers and birds for our good psychological development. And yet, there are hundreds and hundreds of children in the developed world who never see nature, because they're growing up in concrete and all they know is virtual reality, with no opportunity to go and lie in the sun, or in the forest, with the dappled sun-specks coming down from the canopy above. As I was traveling around the world, you know, I had to leave the forest -- that's where I love to be. I had to leave these fascinating chimpanzees for my students and field staff to continue studying because, finding they dwindled from about two million 100 years ago to about 150,000 now, I knew I had to leave the forest to do what I could to raise awareness around the world. And the more I talked about the chimpanzees' plight, the more I realized the fact that everything's interconnected, and the problems of the developing world so often stem from the greed of the developed world, and everything was joining together, and making -- not sense, hope lies in sense, you said -- it's making a nonsense. How can we do it? Somebody said that yesterday. And as I was traveling around, I kept meeting young people who'd lost hope. They were feeling despair, they were feeling, \"Well, it doesn't matter what we do; eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die. Everything is hopeless -- we're always being told so by the media.\" And then I met some who were angry, and anger that can turn to violence, and we're all familiar with that. And I have three little grandchildren, and when some of these students would say to me at high school or university, they'd say, \"We're angry,\" or \"We're filled with despair, because we feel you've compromised our future, and there's nothing we can do about it.\" And I looked in the eyes of my little grandchildren, and think how much we've harmed this planet since I was their age. I feel this deep shame, and that's why in 1991 in Tanzania, I started a program that's called Roots and Shoots. There's little brochures all around outside, and if any of you have anything to do with children and care about their future, I beg that you pick up that brochure. And Roots and Shoots is a program for hope. Roots make a firm foundation. Shoots seem tiny, but to reach the sun they can break through brick walls. See the brick walls as all the problems that we've inflicted on this planet. Then, you see, it is a message of hope. Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world can break through, and can make this a better world. And the most important message of Roots and Shoots is that every single individual makes a difference. Every individual has a role to play. Every one of us impacts the world around us everyday, and you scientists know that you can't actually -- even if you stay in bed all day, you're breathing oxygen and giving out CO2, and probably going to the loo, and things like that -- you're making a difference in the world. So, the Roots and Shoots program involves youth in three kinds of projects. And these are projects to make the world around them a better place. One project to show care and concern for your own human community. One for animals, including domestic animals -- and I have to say, I learned everything I know about animal behavior even before I got to Gombe and the chimps from my dog, Rusty, who was my childhood companion. And the third kind of project: something for the local environment. So what the kids do depends first of all, how old are they -- and we go now from pre-school right through university. It's going to depend whether they're inner-city or rural. It's going to depend if they're wealthy or impoverished. It's going to depend which part, say, of America they're in. We're in every state now, and the problems in Florida are different from the problems in New York. It's going to depend on which country they're in -- and we're already in 60-plus countries, with about 5,000 active groups -- and there are groups all over the place that I keep hearing about that I've never even heard of, because the kids are taking the program and spreading it themselves. Why? Because they're buying into it, and they're the ones who get to decide what they're going to do. It isn't something that their parents tell them, or their teachers tell them. That's effective, but if they decide themselves, \"We want to clean this river and put the fish back that used to be there. We want to clear away the toxic soil from this area and have an organic garden. We want to go and spend time with the old people and hear their stories and record their oral histories. We want to go and work in a dog shelter. We want to learn about animals. We want ... \" You know, it goes on and on, and this is very hopeful for me. As I travel around the world 300 days a year, everywhere there's a group of Roots and Shoots of different ages. Everywhere there are children with shining eyes saying, \"Look at the difference we've made.\" And now comes the technology into it, because with this new way of communicating electronically these kids can communicate with each other around the world. And if anyone is interested to help us, we've got so many ideas but we need help -- we need help to create the right kind of system that will help these young people to communicate their excitement. But also -- and this is so important -- to communicate their despair, to say, \"We've tried this and it doesn't work, and what shall we do?\" And then, lo and behold, there's another group answering these kids who may be in America, or maybe this is a group in Israel, saying, \"Yeah, you did it a little bit wrong. This is how you should do it.\" The philosophy is very simple. We do not believe in violence. No violence, no bombs, no guns. That's not the way to solve problems. Violence leads to violence, at least in my view. So how do we solve? The tools for solving the problems are knowledge and understanding. Know the facts, but see how they fit in the big picture. Hard work and persistence --don't give up -- and love and compassion leading to respect for all life. How many more minutes? Two, one? Chris Anderson: One -- one to two. Jane Goodall: Two, two, I'm going to take two. (Laughter) Are you going to come and drag me off? (Laughter) Anyway -- so basically, Roots and Shoots is beginning to change young people's lives. It's what I'm devoting most of my energy to. And I believe that a group like this can have a very major impact, not just because you can share technology with us, but because so many of you have children. And if you take this program out, and give it to your children, they have such a good opportunity to go out and do good, because they've got parents like you. And it's been so clear how much you all care about trying to make this world a better place. It's very encouraging. But the kids do ask me -- and this won't take more than two minutes, I promise -- the kids say, \"Dr. Jane, do you really have hope for the future? You travel, you see all these horrible things happening.\" Firstly, the human brain -- I don't need to say anything about that. Now that we know what the problems are around the world, human brains like yours are rising to solve those problems. And we've talked a lot about that. Secondly, the resilience of nature. We can destroy a river, and we can bring it back to life. We can see a whole area desolated, and it can be brought back to bloom again, with time or a little help. And thirdly, the last speaker talked about -- or the speaker before last, talked about the indomitable human spirit. We are surrounded by the most amazing people who do things that seem to be absolutely impossible. Nelson Mandela -- I take a little piece of limestone from Robben Island Prison, where he labored for 27 years, and came out with so little bitterness, he could lead his people from the horror of apartheid without a bloodbath. Even after the 11th of September -- and I was in New York and I felt the fear -- nevertheless, there was so much human courage, so much love and so much compassion. And then as I went around the country after that and felt the fear -- the fear that was leading to people feeling they couldn't worry about the environment any more, in case they seemed not to be patriotic -- and I was trying to encourage them, somebody came up with a little quotation from Mahatma Gandhi, \"If you look back through human history, you see that every evil regime has been overcome by good.\" And just after that a woman brought me this little bell, and I want to end on this note. She said, \"If you're talking about hope and peace, ring this. This bell is made from metal from a defused landmine, from the killing fields of Pol Pot -- one of the most evil regimes in human history -- where people are now beginning to put their lives back together after the regime has crumbled. So, yes, there is hope, and where is the hope? Is it out there with the politicians? It's in our hands. It's in your hands and my hands and those of our children. It's really up to us. We're the ones who can make a difference. If we lead lives where we consciously leave the lightest possible ecological footprints, if we buy the things that are ethical for us to buy and don't buy the things that are not, we can change the world overnight. Thank you.

Her discovery, at age 17, of a compound that stops fruit-fly brain cells from dying was regarded as a step toward curing Alzheimer's.

It's really an honor and a privilege to be here spending my last day as a teenager. Today I want to talk to you about the future, but first I'm going to tell you a bit about the past. My story starts way before I was born. My grandmother was on a train to Auschwitz, the death camp. And she was going along the tracks, and the tracks split. And somehow -- we don't really know exactly the whole story -- but the train took the wrong track and went to a work camp rather than the death camp. My grandmother survived and married my grandfather. They were living in Hungary, and my mother was born. And when my mother was two years old, the Hungarian revolution was raging, and they decided to escape Hungary. They got on a boat, and yet another divergence -- the boat was either going to Canada or to Australia. They got on and didn't know where they were going, and ended up in Canada. So, to make a long story short, they came to Canada. My grandmother was a chemist. She worked at the Banting Institute in Toronto, and at 44 she died of stomach cancer. I never met my grandmother, but I carry on her name -- her exact name, Eva Vertes -- and I like to think I carry on her scientific passion, too. "},{"time":"01:27","text":"I found this passion not far from here, actually, when I was nine years old. My family was on a road trip and we were in the Grand Canyon. And I had never been a reader when I was young -- my dad had tried me with the Hardy Boys; I tried Nancy Drew; I tried all that -- and I just didn't like reading books. And my mother bought this book when we were at the Grand Canyon called \"The Hot Zone.\" It was all about the outbreak of the Ebola virus. And something about it just kind of drew me towards it. There was this big sort of bumpy-looking virus on the cover, and I just wanted to read it. I picked up that book, and as we drove from the edge of the Grand Canyon to Big Sur, and to, actually, here where we are today, in Monterey, I read that book, and from when I was reading that book, I knew that I wanted to have a life in medicine. I wanted to be like the explorers I'd read about in the book, who went into the jungles of Africa, went into the research labs and just tried to figure out what this deadly virus was. So from that moment on, I read every medical book I could get my hands on, and I just loved it so much. I was a passive observer of the medical world. "},{"time":"02:40","text":"It wasn't until I entered high school that I thought, \"Maybe now, you know -- being a big high school kid -- I can maybe become an active part of this big medical world.\" I was 14, and I emailed professors at the local university to see if maybe I could go work in their lab. And hardly anyone responded. But I mean, why would they respond to a 14-year-old, anyway? And I got to go talk to one professor, Dr. Jacobs, who accepted me into the lab. At that time, I was really interested in neuroscience and wanted to do a research project in neurology -- specifically looking at the effects of heavy metals on the developing nervous system. So I started that, and worked in his lab for a year, and found the results that I guess you'd expect to find when you feed fruit flies heavy metals -- that it really, really impaired the nervous system. The spinal cord had breaks. The neurons were crossing in every which way. And from then I wanted to look not at impairment, but at prevention of impairment. "},{"time":"03:47","text":"So that's what led me to Alzheimer's. I started reading about Alzheimer's and tried to familiarize myself with the research, and at the same time when I was in the -- I was reading in the medical library one day, and I read this article about something called \"purine derivatives.\" And they seemed to have cell growth-promoting properties. And being naive about the whole field, I kind of thought, \"Oh, you have cell death in Alzheimer's which is causing the memory deficit, and then you have this compound -- purine derivatives -- that are promoting cell growth.\" And so I thought, \"Maybe if it can promote cell growth, it can inhibit cell death, too.\" And so that's the project that I pursued for that year, and it's continuing now as well, and found that a specific purine derivative called \"guanidine\" had inhibited the cell growth by approximately 60 percent. So I presented those results at the International Science Fair, which was just one of the most amazing experiences of my life. And there I was awarded \"Best in the World in Medicine,\" which allowed me to get in, or at least get a foot in the door of the big medical world. "},{"time":"04:57","text":"And from then on, since I was now in this huge exciting world, I wanted to explore it all. I wanted it all at once, but knew I couldn't really get that. And I stumbled across something called \"cancer stem cells.\" And this is really what I want to talk to you about today -- about cancer. At first when I heard of cancer stem cells, I didn't really know how to put the two together. I'd heard of stem cells, and I'd heard of them as the panacea of the future -- the therapy of many diseases to come in the future, perhaps. But I'd heard of cancer as the most feared disease of our time, so how did the good and bad go together? Last summer I worked at Stanford University, doing some research on cancer stem cells. And while I was doing this, I was reading the cancer literature, trying to -- again -- familiarize myself with this new medical field. And it seemed that tumors actually begin from a stem cell. This fascinated me. The more I read, the more I looked at cancer differently and almost became less fearful of it. "},{"time":"06:08","text":"It seems that cancer is a direct result to injury. If you smoke, you damage your lung tissue, and then lung cancer arises. If you drink, you damage your liver, and then liver cancer occurs. And it was really interesting -- there were articles correlating if you have a bone fracture, and then bone cancer arises. Because what stem cells are -- they're these phenomenal cells that really have the ability to differentiate into any type of tissue. So, if the body is sensing that you have damage to an organ and then it's initiating cancer, it's almost as if this is a repair response. And the cancer, the body is saying the lung tissue is damaged, we need to repair the lung. And cancer is originating in the lung trying to repair -- because you have this excessive proliferation of these remarkable cells that really have the potential to become lung tissue. But it's almost as if the body has originated this ingenious response, but can't quite control it. It hasn't yet become fine-tuned enough to finish what has been initiated. So this really, really fascinated me. "},{"time":"07:21","text":"And I really think that we can't think about cancer -- let alone any disease -- in such black-and-white terms. If we eliminate cancer the way we're trying to do now, with chemotherapy and radiation, we're bombarding the body or the cancer with toxins, or with radiation, trying to kill it. It's almost as if we're getting back to this starting point. We're removing the cancer cells, but we're revealing the previous damage that the body has tried to fix. Shouldn't we think about manipulation, rather than elimination? If somehow we can cause these cells to differentiate -- to become bone tissue, lung tissue, liver tissue, whatever that cancer has been put there to do -- it would be a repair process. We'd end up better than we were before cancer. So, this really changed my view of looking at cancer. And while I was reading all these articles about cancer, it seemed that the articles -- a lot of them -- focused on, you know, the genetics of breast cancer, and the genesis and the progression of breast cancer -- tracking the cancer through the body, tracing where it is, where it goes. "},{"time":"08:35","text":"But it struck me that I'd never heard of cancer of the heart, or cancer of any skeletal muscle for that matter. And skeletal muscle constitutes 50 percent of our body, or over 50 percent of our body. And so at first I kind of thought, \"Well, maybe there's some obvious explanation why skeletal muscle doesn't get cancer -- at least not that I know of.\" So, I looked further into it, found as many articles as I could, and it was amazing -- because it turned out that it was very rare. Some articles even went as far as to say that skeletal muscle tissue is resistant to cancer, and furthermore, not only to cancer, but of metastases going to skeletal muscle. And what metastases are is when the tumor -- when a piece -- breaks off and travels through the blood stream and goes to a different organ. That's what a metastasis is. It's the part of cancer that is the most dangerous. If cancer was localized, we could likely remove it, or somehow -- you know, it's contained. It's very contained. But once it starts moving throughout the body, that's when it becomes deadly. So the fact that not only did cancer not seem to originate in skeletal muscles, but cancer didn't seem to go to skeletal muscle -- there seemed to be something here. So these articles were saying, you know, \"Skeletal -- metastasis to skeletal muscle -- is very rare.\" But it was left at that. No one seemed to be asking why. "},{"time":"10:02","text":"So I decided to ask why. At first -- the first thing I did was I emailed some professors who specialized in skeletal muscle physiology, and pretty much said, \"Hey, it seems like cancer doesn't really go to skeletal muscle. Is there a reason for this?\" And a lot of the replies I got were that muscle is terminally differentiated tissue. Meaning that you have muscle cells, but they're not dividing, so it doesn't seem like a good target for cancer to hijack. But then again, this fact that the metastases didn't go to skeletal muscle made that seem unlikely. And furthermore, that nervous tissue -- brain -- gets cancer, and brain cells are also terminally differentiated. So I decided to ask why. And here's some of, I guess, my hypotheses that I'll be starting to investigate this May at the Sylvester Cancer Institute in Miami. And I guess I'll keep investigating until I get the answers. But I know that in science, once you get the answers, inevitably you're going to have more questions. So I guess you could say that I'll probably be doing this for the rest of my life. "},{"time":"11:20","text":"Some of my hypotheses are that when you first think about skeletal muscle, there's a lot of blood vessels going to skeletal muscle. And the first thing that makes me think is that blood vessels are like highways for the tumor cells. Tumor cells can travel through the blood vessels. And you think, the more highways there are in a tissue, the more likely it is to get cancer or to get metastases. So first of all I thought, you know, \"Wouldn't it be favorable to cancer getting to skeletal muscle?\" And as well, cancer tumors require a process called angiogenesis, which is really, the tumor recruits the blood vessels to itself to supply itself with nutrients so it can grow. Without angiogenesis, the tumor remains the size of a pinpoint and it's not harmful. So angiogenesis is really a central process to the pathogenesis of cancer. "},{"time":"12:17","text":"And one article that really stood out to me when I was just reading about this, trying to figure out why cancer doesn't go to skeletal muscle, was that it had reported 16 percent of micro-metastases to skeletal muscle upon autopsy. 16 percent! Meaning that there were these pinpoint tumors in skeletal muscle, but only .16 percent of actual metastases -- suggesting that maybe skeletal muscle is able to control the angiogenesis, is able to control the tumors recruiting these blood vessels. We use skeletal muscles so much. It's the one portion of our body -- our heart's always beating. We're always moving our muscles. Is it possible that muscle somehow intuitively knows that it needs this blood supply? It needs to be constantly contracting, so therefore it's almost selfish. It's grabbing its blood vessels for itself. Therefore, when a tumor comes into skeletal muscle tissue, it can't get a blood supply, and can't grow. "},{"time":"13:20","text":"So this suggests that maybe if there is an anti-angiogenic factor in skeletal muscle -- or perhaps even more, an angiogenic routing factor, so it can actually direct where the blood vessels grow -- this could be a potential future therapy for cancer. And another thing that's really interesting is that there's this whole -- the way tumors move throughout the body, it's a very complex system -- and there's something called the chemokine network. And chemokines are essentially chemical attractants, and they're the stop and go signals for cancer. So a tumor expresses chemokine receptors, and another organ -- a distant organ somewhere in the body -- will have the corresponding chemokines, and the tumor will see these chemokines and migrate towards it. Is it possible that skeletal muscle doesn't express this type of molecules? And the other really interesting thing is that when skeletal muscle -- there's been several reports that when skeletal muscle is injured, that's what correlates with metastases going to skeletal muscle. "},{"time":"14:29","text":"And, furthermore, when skeletal muscle is injured, that's what causes chemokines -- these signals saying, \"Cancer, you can come to me,\" the \"go signs\" for the tumors -- it causes them to highly express these chemokines. So, there's so much interplay here. I mean, there are so many possibilities for why tumors don't go to skeletal muscle. But it seems like by investigating, by attacking cancer, by searching where cancer is not, there has got to be something -- there's got to be something -- that's making this tissue resistant to tumors. And can we utilize -- can we take this property, this compound, this receptor, whatever it is that's controlling these anti-tumor properties and apply it to cancer therapy in general? Now, one thing that kind of ties the resistance of skeletal muscle to cancer -- to the cancer as a repair response gone out of control in the body -- is that skeletal muscle has a factor in it called \"MyoD.\" And what MyoD essentially does is, it causes cells to differentiate into muscle cells. So this compound, MyoD, has been tested on a lot of different cell types and been shown to actually convert this variety of cell types into skeletal muscle cells. So, is it possible that the tumor cells are going to the skeletal muscle tissue, but once in contact inside the skeletal muscle tissue, MyoD acts upon these tumor cells and causes them to become skeletal muscle cells? Maybe tumor cells are being disguised as skeletal muscle cells, and this is why it seems as if it is so rare. "},{"time":"16:29","text":"It's not harmful; it has just repaired the muscle. Muscle is constantly being used -- constantly being damaged. If every time we tore a muscle or every time we stretched a muscle or moved in a wrong way, cancer occurred -- I mean, everybody would have cancer almost. And I hate to say that. But it seems as though muscle cell, possibly because of all its use, has adapted faster than other body tissues to respond to injury, to fine-tune this repair response and actually be able to finish the process which the body wants to finish. I really believe that the human body is very, very smart, and we can't counteract something the body is saying to do. "},{"time":"17:15","text":"It's different when a bacteria comes into the body -- that's a foreign object -- we want that out. But when the body is actually initiating a process and we're calling it a disease, it doesn't seem as though elimination is the right solution. So even to go from there, it's possible, although far-fetched, that in the future we could almost think of cancer being used as a therapy. If those diseases where tissues are deteriorating -- for example Alzheimer's, where the brain, the brain cells, die and we need to restore new brain cells, new functional brain cells -- what if we could, in the future, use cancer? A tumor -- put it in the brain and cause it to differentiate into brain cells? "},{"time":"18:04","text":"That's a very far-fetched idea, but I really believe that it may be possible. These cells are so versatile, these cancer cells are so versatile -- we just have to manipulate them in the right way. And again, some of these may be far-fetched, but I figured if there's anywhere to present far-fetched ideas, it's here at TED, so thank you very much.

How could I have made shapes like that or done stuff like that?\" It's taken several years to now look at it detached and say -- as you walk around the corner and a piece of it works with the road and the street, and it appears to have a relationship -- that I started to like it.

Luckily, today most of the people I'm working with are people I really like. Richard Koshalek is probably one of the main reasons that Disney Hall came to me. He's been a cheerleader for quite a long time. There aren't many people around that are really involved with architecture as clients. If you think about the world, and even just in this audience, most of us are involved with buildings. Nothing that you would call architecture, right? And so to find one, a guy like that, you hang on to him. He's become the head of Art Center, and there's a building by Craig Ellwood there. I knew Craig and respected him. They want to add to it and it's hard to add to a building like that -- it's a beautiful, minimalist, black steel building -- and Richard wants to add a library and more student stuff and it's a lot of acreage. I convinced him to let me bring in another architect from Portugal: Alvaro Siza. "},{"time":"08:58","text":"RSW: Why did you want that? "},{"time":"09:00","text":"FG: I knew you'd ask that question. "},{"time":"09:03","text":"It was intuitive. (Laughter) "},{"time":"09:09","text":"Alvaro Siza grew up and lived in Portugal and is probably considered the Portuguese main guy in architecture. I visited with him a few years ago and he showed me his early work, and his early work had a resemblance to my early work. When I came out of college, I started to try to do things contextually in Southern California, and you got into the logic of Spanish colonial tile roofs and things like that. I tried to understand that language as a beginning, as a place to jump off, and there was so much of it being done by spec builders and it was trivialized so much that it wasn't ... I just stopped. I mean, Charlie Moore did a bunch of it, but it didn't feel good to me. Siza, on the other hand, continued in Portugal where the real stuff was and evolved a modern language that relates to that historic language. And I always felt that he should come to Southern California and do a building. I tried to get him a couple of jobs and they didn't pan out. I like the idea of collaboration with people like that because it pushes you. I've done it with Claes Oldenburg and with Richard Serra, who doesn't think architecture is art. Did you see that thing? RSW: No. What did he say? "},{"time":"11:05","text":"FG: He calls architecture \"plumbing.\" (Laughter) "},{"time":"11:10","text":"FG: Anyway, the Siza thing. It's a richer experience.

Everybody doing their thing makes a very chaotic environment, and if you can figure out how to work off each other -- if you can get a bunch of people who respect each other's work and play off each other, you might be able to create models for how to build sections of the city without resorting to the one architect. Like the Rockefeller Center model, which is kind of from another era. "},{"time":"12:59","text":"RSW: I found the most remarkable thing. My preconception of Bilbao was this wonderful building, you go inside and there'd be extraordinary spaces. I'd seen drawings you had presented here at TED.

That was the real surprise of Bilbao. "},{"time":"13:27","text":"FG: But you know, Richard, most architects when they present their work -- most of the people we know, you get up and you talk about your work, and it's almost like you tell everybody you're a good guy by saying, \"Look, I'm worried about the context, I'm worried about the city, I'm worried about my client, I worry about budget, that I'm on time.\" Blah, blah, blah and all that stuff. And it's like cleansing yourself so that you can ... by saying all that, it means your work is good somehow. And I think everybody -- I mean that should be a matter of fact, like gravity. You're not going to defy gravity. You've got to work with the building department. If you don't meet the budgets, you're not going to get much work. If it leaks -- Bilbao did not leak.

What do you bring to it? And I think that's what I've always been interested in, is that -- which is a personal kind of expression. Bilbao, I think, shows that you can have that kind of personal expression and still touch all the bases that are necessary of fitting into the city. That's what reminded me of it. And I think that's the issue, you know; it's the \"then what\" that most clients who hire architects -- most clients aren't hiring architects for that. They're hiring them to get it done, get it on budget, be polite, and they're missing out on the real value of an architect.

In one case, I flew all the way to Malaga with a team because the thing was signed with seals and various very official seals from the city, and that they wanted me to come and do a building in their port. I asked them what kind of building it was. \"When you get here we'll explain it.\" Blah, blah, blah. So four of us went. And they took us -- they put us up in a great hotel and we were looking over the bay, and then they took us in a boat out in the water and showed us all these sights in the harbor. Each one was more beautiful than the other. And then we were going to have lunch with the mayor and we were going to have dinner with the most important people in Malaga. Just before going to lunch with the mayor, we went to the harbor commissioner. It was a table as long as this carpet and the harbor commissioner was here, and I was here, and my guys.

But I want to start\nwith my work on romantic love, because that's my most recent work. What I and my colleagues did was put\n32 people, who were madly in love, into a functional MRI brain scanner. 17 who were madly in love\nand their love was accepted; and 15 who were madly in love\nand they had just been dumped. And so I want to tell you\nabout that first, and then go on into where\nI think love is going. "},{"time":"00:36","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"00:38","text":"\"What 'tis to love?\" Shakespeare said. I think our ancestors -- I think human beings have been\nwondering about this question since they sat around their campfires or lay and watched\nthe stars a million years ago. I started out by trying to figure out\nwhat romantic love was by looking at the last 45 years\nof the psychological research and as it turns out, there's a very specific group of things\nthat happen when you fall in love. The first thing that happens is, a person begins to take on\nwhat I call, \"special meaning.\" As a truck driver once said to me, \"The world had a new center,\nand that center was Mary Anne.\" "},{"time":"01:21","text":"George Bernard Shaw said it differently. \"Love consists of overestimating\nthe differences between one woman and another.\" And indeed, that's what we do. "},{"time":"01:30","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"01:33","text":"And then you just focus on this person. You can list what you\ndon't like about them, but then you sweep that aside\nand focus on what you do. As Chaucer said, \"Love is blind.\" "},{"time":"01:46","text":"In trying to understand romantic love, I decided I would read poetry\nfrom all over the world, and I just want to give\nyou one very short poem from eighth-century China, because it's an almost perfect example of a man who is focused totally\non a particular woman. It's a little bit like when you are\nmadly in love with somebody and you walk into a parking lot -- their car is different\nfrom every other car in the parking lot. Their wine glass at dinner is different from every other wine glass\nat the dinner party. And in this case, a man got hooked\non a bamboo sleeping mat. "},{"time":"02:19","text":"And it goes like this. It's by a guy called Yuan Zhen. \"I cannot bear to put away\nthe bamboo sleeping mat. The night I brought you home,\nI watched you roll it out.\" He became hooked on a sleeping mat, probably because of elevated activity\nof dopamine in his brain, just like with you and me. "},{"time":"02:37","text":"But anyway, not only does this person\ntake on special meaning, you focus your attention on them. You aggrandize them. But you have intense energy. As one Polynesian said,\n\"I felt like jumping in the sky.\" You're up all night.\nYou're walking till dawn. You feel intense elation\nwhen things are going well; mood swings into horrible despair\nwhen things are going poorly. Real dependence on this person. As one businessman in New York said to me, \"Anything she liked, I liked.\" Simple. Romantic love is very simple. "},{"time":"03:10","text":"You become extremely sexually possessive. You know, if you're just sleeping\nwith somebody casually, you don't really care\nif they're sleeping with somebody else. But the moment you fall in love, you become extremely\nsexually possessive of them. I think there's a Darwinian\npurpose to this. The whole point of this\nis to pull two people together strongly enough to begin\nto rear babies as a team. "},{"time":"03:33","text":"But the main characteristics\nof romantic love are craving: an intense craving\nto be with a particular person, not just sexually, but emotionally. It would be nice to go to bed with them, but you want them to call you\non the telephone, to invite you out, etc., to tell you that they love you. The other main characteristic\nis motivation. The motor in the brain begins to crank,\nand you want this person. "},{"time":"04:01","text":"And last but not least,\nit is an obsession. Before I put these people\nin the MRI machine, I would ask them all kinds of questions. But my most important question\nwas always the same. It was: \"What percentage of the day\nand night do you think about this person?\" And indeed, they would say, \"All day. All night. I can never stop thinking\nabout him or her.\" "},{"time":"04:25","text":"And then, the very last question -- I would always have to work\nmyself up to this question, because I'm not a psychologist. I don't work with people\nin any kind of traumatic situation. My final question was always the same. I would say,\n\"Would you die for him or her?\" And, indeed, these people would say \"Yes!\" as if I had asked them to pass the salt. I was just staggered by it. "},{"time":"04:47","text":"So we scanned their brains, looking at a photograph\nof their sweetheart and looking at a neutral photograph, with a distraction task in between. So we could look at the same brain\nwhen it was in that heightened state and when it was in a resting state. And we found activity\nin a lot of brain regions. In fact, one of the most important\nwas a brain region that becomes active\nwhen you feel the rush of cocaine. And indeed, that's exactly what happens. "},{"time":"05:15","text":"I began to realize that romantic love\nis not an emotion. In fact, I had always thought\nit was a series of emotions, from very high to very low. But actually, it's a drive. It comes from the motor of the mind, the wanting part of the mind,\nthe craving part of the mind. The kind of part of the mind when you're reaching\nfor that piece of chocolate, when you want to win\nthat promotion at work. The motor of the brain. It's a drive. "},{"time":"05:43","text":"And in fact, I think it's more powerful\nthan the sex drive. You know, if you ask somebody\nto go to bed with you, and they say, \"No, thank you,\" you certainly don't kill yourself\nor slip into a clinical depression. But certainly, around the world, people who are rejected\nin love will kill for it. People live for love. They kill for love. They die for love. They have songs, poems, novels, sculptures, paintings, myths, legends. In over 175 societies, people have left their evidence\nof this powerful brain system. I have come to think it's one of the most powerful\nbrain systems on Earth for both great joy and great sorrow. "},{"time":"06:27","text":"And I've also come to think that it's one of three\nbasically different brain systems that evolved from mating and reproduction. One is the sex drive:\nthe craving for sexual gratification. W.H. Auden called it\nan \"intolerable neural itch,\" and indeed, that's what it is. It keeps bothering you\na little bit, like being hungry. The second of these three brain\nsystems is romantic love: that elation, obsession of early love. And the third brain system is attachment: that sense of calm and security\nyou can feel for a long-term partner. "},{"time":"07:00","text":"And I think that the sex drive\nevolved to get you out there, looking for a whole range of partners. You can feel it when you're just\ndriving along in your car. It can be focused on nobody. I think romantic love evolved\nto enable you to focus your mating energy on just one individual at a time, thereby conserving mating time and energy. And I think that attachment,\nthe third brain system, evolved to enable you to tolerate\nthis human being at least long enough to raise\na child together as a team. So with that preamble, I want to go into discussing\nthe two most profound social trends. One of the last 10,000 years and the other,\ncertainly of the last 25 years, that are going to have an impact\non these three different brain systems: lust, romantic love\nand deep attachment to a partner. "},{"time":"07:54","text":"The first is women working,\nmoving into the workforce. I've looked at 130 societies through the demographic yearbooks\nof the United Nations. Everywhere in the world,\n129 out of 130 of them, women are not only moving\ninto the job market -- sometimes very, very slowly,\nbut they are moving into the job market -- and they are very slowly closing\nthat gap between men and women in terms of economic power,\nhealth and education. It's very slow. "},{"time":"08:26","text":"For every trend on this planet,\nthere's a counter-trend. We all know of them, but nevertheless -- the Arabs say, \"The dogs may bark,\nbut the caravan moves on.\" And, indeed, that caravan is moving on. Women are moving back into the job market. And I say back into the job market,\nbecause this is not new. For millions of years,\non the grasslands of Africa, women commuted to work\nto gather their vegetables. They came home with 60 to 80 percent\nof the evening meal. The double income family was the standard. And women were regarded\nas just as economically, socially and sexually powerful as men. In short, we're really\nmoving forward to the past. "},{"time":"09:12","text":"Then, women's worst\ninvention was the plow. With the beginning of plow agriculture,\nmen's roles became extremely powerful. Women lost their ancient\njobs as collectors, but then with the industrial revolution\nand the post-industrial revolution they're moving back into the job market. In short, they are acquiring the status\nthat they had a million years ago, 10,000 years ago, 100,000 years ago.

There's much we have in common, but there's a whole lot\nthat we do not have in common.

Because the female parts\nof the brain are better connected, they tend to collect more\npieces of data when they think, put them into more complex patterns,\nsee more options and outcomes.

She’s best known as an expert on romantic love."},"transcript":[{"time":"00:00","text":"I'd like to talk today\nabout the two biggest social trends in the coming century, and perhaps in the next 10,000 years. But I want to start\nwith my work on romantic love, because that's my most recent work. What I and my colleagues did was put\n32 people, who were madly in love, into a functional MRI brain scanner. 17 who were madly in love\nand their love was accepted; and 15 who were madly in love\nand they had just been dumped. And so I want to tell you\nabout that first, and then go on into where\nI think love is going. "},{"time":"00:36","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"00:38","text":"\"What 'tis to love?\" Shakespeare said. I think our ancestors -- I think human beings have been\nwondering about this question since they sat around their campfires or lay and watched\nthe stars a million years ago. I started out by trying to figure out\nwhat romantic love was by looking at the last 45 years\nof the psychological research and as it turns out, there's a very specific group of things\nthat happen when you fall in love. The first thing that happens is, a person begins to take on\nwhat I call, \"special meaning.\" As a truck driver once said to me, \"The world had a new center,\nand that center was Mary Anne.\" "},{"time":"01:21","text":"George Bernard Shaw said it differently. \"Love consists of overestimating\nthe differences between one woman and another.\" And indeed, that's what we do. "},{"time":"01:30","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"01:33","text":"And then you just focus on this person. You can list what you\ndon't like about them, but then you sweep that aside\nand focus on what you do. As Chaucer said, \"Love is blind.\" "},{"time":"01:46","text":"In trying to understand romantic love, I decided I would read poetry\nfrom all over the world, and I just want to give\nyou one very short poem from eighth-century China, because it's an almost perfect example of a man who is focused totally\non a particular woman. It's a little bit like when you are\nmadly in love with somebody and you walk into a parking lot -- their car is different\nfrom every other car in the parking lot. Their wine glass at dinner is different from every other wine glass\nat the dinner party. And in this case, a man got hooked\non a bamboo sleeping mat. "},{"time":"02:19","text":"And it goes like this. It's by a guy called Yuan Zhen. \"I cannot bear to put away\nthe bamboo sleeping mat. The night I brought you home,\nI watched you roll it out.\" He became hooked on a sleeping mat, probably because of elevated activity\nof dopamine in his brain, just like with you and me. "},{"time":"02:37","text":"But anyway, not only does this person\ntake on special meaning, you focus your attention on them. You aggrandize them. But you have intense energy. As one Polynesian said,\n\"I felt like jumping in the sky.\" You're up all night.\nYou're walking till dawn. You feel intense elation\nwhen things are going well; mood swings into horrible despair\nwhen things are going poorly. Real dependence on this person. As one businessman in New York said to me, \"Anything she liked, I liked.\" Simple. Romantic love is very simple. "},{"time":"03:10","text":"You become extremely sexually possessive. You know, if you're just sleeping\nwith somebody casually, you don't really care\nif they're sleeping with somebody else. But the moment you fall in love, you become extremely\nsexually possessive of them. I think there's a Darwinian\npurpose to this. The whole point of this\nis to pull two people together strongly enough to begin\nto rear babies as a team. "},{"time":"03:33","text":"But the main characteristics\nof romantic love are craving: an intense craving\nto be with a particular person, not just sexually, but emotionally. It would be nice to go to bed with them, but you want them to call you\non the telephone, to invite you out, etc., to tell you that they love you. The other main characteristic\nis motivation. The motor in the brain begins to crank,\nand you want this person. "},{"time":"04:01","text":"And last but not least,\nit is an obsession. Before I put these people\nin the MRI machine, I would ask them all kinds of questions. But my most important question\nwas always the same. It was: \"What percentage of the day\nand night do you think about this person?\" And indeed, they would say, \"All day. All night. I can never stop thinking\nabout him or her.\" "},{"time":"04:25","text":"And then, the very last question -- I would always have to work\nmyself up to this question, because I'm not a psychologist. I don't work with people\nin any kind of traumatic situation. My final question was always the same. I would say,\n\"Would you die for him or her?\" And, indeed, these people would say \"Yes!\" as if I had asked them to pass the salt. I was just staggered by it. "},{"time":"04:47","text":"So we scanned their brains, looking at a photograph\nof their sweetheart and looking at a neutral photograph, with a distraction task in between. So we could look at the same brain\nwhen it was in that heightened state and when it was in a resting state. And we found activity\nin a lot of brain regions. In fact, one of the most important\nwas a brain region that becomes active\nwhen you feel the rush of cocaine. And indeed, that's exactly what happens. "},{"time":"05:15","text":"I began to realize that romantic love\nis not an emotion. In fact, I had always thought\nit was a series of emotions, from very high to very low. But actually, it's a drive. It comes from the motor of the mind, the wanting part of the mind,\nthe craving part of the mind. The kind of part of the mind when you're reaching\nfor that piece of chocolate, when you want to win\nthat promotion at work. The motor of the brain. It's a drive. "},{"time":"05:43","text":"And in fact, I think it's more powerful\nthan the sex drive. You know, if you ask somebody\nto go to bed with you, and they say, \"No, thank you,\" you certainly don't kill yourself\nor slip into a clinical depression. But certainly, around the world, people who are rejected\nin love will kill for it. People live for love. They kill for love. They die for love. They have songs, poems, novels, sculptures, paintings, myths, legends. In over 175 societies, people have left their evidence\nof this powerful brain system. I have come to think it's one of the most powerful\nbrain systems on Earth for both great joy and great sorrow. "},{"time":"06:27","text":"And I've also come to think that it's one of three\nbasically different brain systems that evolved from mating and reproduction. One is the sex drive:\nthe craving for sexual gratification. W.H. Auden called it\nan \"intolerable neural itch,\" and indeed, that's what it is. It keeps bothering you\na little bit, like being hungry. The second of these three brain\nsystems is romantic love: that elation, obsession of early love. And the third brain system is attachment: that sense of calm and security\nyou can feel for a long-term partner. "},{"time":"07:00","text":"And I think that the sex drive\nevolved to get you out there, looking for a whole range of partners. You can feel it when you're just\ndriving along in your car. It can be focused on nobody. I think romantic love evolved\nto enable you to focus your mating energy on just one individual at a time, thereby conserving mating time and energy. And I think that attachment,\nthe third brain system, evolved to enable you to tolerate\nthis human being at least long enough to raise\na child together as a team. So with that preamble, I want to go into discussing\nthe two most profound social trends. One of the last 10,000 years and the other,\ncertainly of the last 25 years, that are going to have an impact\non these three different brain systems: lust, romantic love\nand deep attachment to a partner. "},{"time":"07:54","text":"The first is women working,\nmoving into the workforce. I've looked at 130 societies through the demographic yearbooks\nof the United Nations. Everywhere in the world,\n129 out of 130 of them, women are not only moving\ninto the job market -- sometimes very, very slowly,\nbut they are moving into the job market -- and they are very slowly closing\nthat gap between men and women in terms of economic power,\nhealth and education. It's very slow. "},{"time":"08:26","text":"For every trend on this planet,\nthere's a counter-trend. We all know of them, but nevertheless -- the Arabs say, \"The dogs may bark,\nbut the caravan moves on.\" And, indeed, that caravan is moving on. Women are moving back into the job market. And I say back into the job market,\nbecause this is not new. For millions of years,\non the grasslands of Africa, women commuted to work\nto gather their vegetables. They came home with 60 to 80 percent\nof the evening meal. The double income family was the standard. And women were regarded\nas just as economically, socially and sexually powerful as men. In short, we're really\nmoving forward to the past. "},{"time":"09:12","text":"Then, women's worst\ninvention was the plow. With the beginning of plow agriculture,\nmen's roles became extremely powerful. Women lost their ancient\njobs as collectors, but then with the industrial revolution\nand the post-industrial revolution they're moving back into the job market. In short, they are acquiring the status\nthat they had a million years ago, 10,000 years ago, 100,000 years ago. We are seeing now one\nof the most remarkable traditions in the history of the human animal. And it's going to have an impact. "},{"time":"09:50","text":"I generally give a whole lecture on the impact of women\non the business community. I'll say just a couple of things,\nand then go on to sex and love. There's a lot of gender differences; anybody who thinks men and women are alike simply never had a boy and a girl child. I don't know why they want to think\nthat men and women are alike. There's much we have in common, but there's a whole lot\nthat we do not have in common. "},{"time":"10:11","text":"We are -- in the words of Ted Hughes, \"I think that we are like two feet.\nWe need each other to get ahead.\" But we did not evolve\nto have the same brain. And we're finding more and more\ngender differences in the brain. I'll only just use a couple\nand then move on to sex and love. One of them is women's verbal ability. Women can talk. "},{"time":"10:31","text":"Women's ability to find the right word\nrapidly, basic articulation goes up in the middle\nof the menstrual cycle, when estrogen levels peak. But even at menstruation,\nthey're better than the average man. Women can talk. They've been doing it for a million years;\nwords were women's tools. They held that baby\nin front of their face, cajoling it, reprimanding it,\neducating it with words. And, indeed, they're becoming\na very powerful force. "},{"time":"10:57","text":"Even in places like India and Japan, where women are not moving rapidly\ninto the regular job market, they're moving into journalism. And I think that the television\nis like the global campfire. We sit around it and it shapes our minds. Almost always, when I'm on TV,\nthe producer who calls me, who negotiates what we're going to say, is a woman. In fact, Solzhenitsyn once said, \"To have a great writer\nis to have another government.\" "},{"time":"11:29","text":"Today 54 percent of people\nwho are writers in America are women. It's one of many, many\ncharacteristics that women have that they will bring into the job market. They've got incredible people skills,\nnegotiating skills. They're highly imaginative. We now know the brain circuitry\nof imagination, of long-term planning. They tend to be web thinkers. Because the female parts\nof the brain are better connected, they tend to collect more\npieces of data when they think, put them into more complex patterns,\nsee more options and outcomes. They tend to be contextual,\nholistic thinkers, what I call web thinkers. "},{"time":"12:08","text":"Men tend to -- and these are averages -- tend to get rid of what they regard\nas extraneous, focus on what they do, and move in a more\nstep-by-step thinking pattern. They're both perfectly good\nways of thinking. We need both of them to get ahead. In fact, there's many more\nmale geniuses in the world. And there's also many more\nmale idiots in the world. "},{"time":"12:31","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"12:33","text":"When the male brain works well,\nit works extremely well. And what I really think\nthat we're doing is, we're moving towards\na collaborative society, a society in which the talents\nof both men and women are becoming understood\nand valued and employed. "},{"time":"12:49","text":"But in fact, women moving\ninto the job market is having a huge impact\non sex and romance and family life. Foremost, women are starting\nto express their sexuality. I'm always astonished\nwhen people come to me and say, \"Why is it that men are so adulterous?\" \"Why do you think\nmore men are adulterous than women?\" \"Well, men are more adulterous!\" And I say, \"Who do you think\nthese men are sleeping with?\" "},{"time":"13:15","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"13:16","text":"And -- basic math! "},{"time":"13:18","text":"Anyway. In the Western world, women start sooner at sex,\nhave more partners, express less remorse\nfor the partners that they do, marry later, have fewer children, leave bad marriages\nin order to get good ones. We are seeing the rise\nof female sexual expression. And, indeed, once again we're moving\nforward to the kind of sexual expression that we probably saw on the grasslands\nof Africa a million years ago, because this is the kind\nof sexual expression that we see in hunting and gathering societies today. "},{"time":"13:52","text":"We're also returning\nto an ancient form of marriage equality. They're now saying that the 21st century is going to be the century of what\nthey call the \"symmetrical marriage,\" or the \"pure marriage,\"\nor the \"companionate marriage.\" This is a marriage between equals, moving forward to a pattern that is highly compatible\nwith the ancient human spirit.

"},"transcript":[{"time":"00:00","text":"It is a thrill to be here at a conference that's devoted to \"Inspired by Nature\" -- you can imagine. And I'm also thrilled to be in the foreplay section. Did you notice this section is foreplay? Because I get to talk about one of my favorite critters, which is the Western Grebe. You haven't lived until you've seen these guys do their courtship dance. I was on Bowman Lake in Glacier National Park, which is a long, skinny lake with sort of mountains upside down in it, and my partner and I have a rowing shell. And so we were rowing, and one of these Western Grebes came along. And what they do for their courtship dance is, they go together, the two of them, the two mates, and they begin to run underwater. They paddle faster, and faster, and faster, until they're going so fast that they literally lift up out of the water, and they're standing upright, sort of paddling the top of the water. And one of these Grebes came along while we were rowing. And so we're in a skull, and we're moving really, really quickly. And this Grebe, I think, sort of, mistaked us for a prospect, and started to run along the water next to us, in a courtship dance -- for miles. It would stop, and then start, and then stop, and then start. Now that is foreplay. (Laughter) "},{"time":"01:35","text":"I came this close to changing species at that moment. Obviously, life can teach us something in the entertainment section. Life has a lot to teach us. But what I'd like to talk about today is what life might teach us in technology and in design. What's happened since the book came out -- the book was mainly about research in biomimicry -- and what's happened since then is architects, designers, engineers -- people who make our world -- have started to call and say, we want a biologist to sit at the design table to help us, in real time, become inspired. Or -- and this is the fun part for me -- we want you to take us out into the natural world. We'll come with a design challenge and we find the champion adapters in the natural world, who might inspire us. "},{"time":"02:29","text":"So this is a picture from a Galapagos trip that we took with some wastewater treatment engineers; they purify wastewater. And some of them were very resistant, actually, to being there. What they said to us at first was, you know, we already do biomimicry. We use bacteria to clean our water. And we said, well, that's not exactly being inspired by nature. That's bioprocessing, you know; that's bio-assisted technology: using an organism to do your wastewater treatment is an old, old technology called \"domestication.\" This is learning something, learning an idea, from an organism and then applying it. And so they still weren't getting it. "},{"time":"03:16","text":"So we went for a walk on the beach and I said, well, give me one of your big problems. Give me a design challenge, sustainability speed bump, that's keeping you from being sustainable. And they said scaling, which is the build-up of minerals inside of pipes. And they said, you know what happens is, mineral -- just like at your house -- mineral builds up. And then the aperture closes, and we have to flush the pipes with toxins, or we have to dig them up. So if we had some way to stop this scaling -- and so I picked up some shells on the beach. And I asked them, what is scaling? What's inside your pipes? And they said, calcium carbonate. And I said, that's what this is; this is calcium carbonate. "},{"time":"03:58","text":"And they didn't know that. They didn't know that what a seashell is, it's templated by proteins, and then ions from the seawater crystallize in place to create a shell. So the same sort of a process, without the proteins, is happening on the inside of their pipes. They didn't know. This is not for lack of information; it's a lack of integration. You know, it's a silo, people in silos. They didn't know that the same thing was happening. So one of them thought about it and said, OK, well, if this is just crystallization that happens automatically out of seawater -- self-assembly -- then why aren't shells infinite in size? What stops the scaling? Why don't they just keep on going? And I said, well, in the same way that they exude a protein and it starts the crystallization -- and then they all sort of leaned in -- they let go of a protein that stops the crystallization. It literally adheres to the growing face of the crystal. And, in fact, there is a product called TPA that's mimicked that protein -- that stop-protein -- and it's an environmentally friendly way to stop scaling in pipes. "},{"time":"05:15","text":"That changed everything. From then on, you could not get these engineers back in the boat. The first day they would take a hike, and it was, click, click, click, click. Five minutes later they were back in the boat. We're done. You know, I've seen that island. After this, they were crawling all over. They would snorkel for as long as we would let them snorkel. What had happened was that they realized that there were organisms out there that had already solved the problems that they had spent their careers trying to solve. "},{"time":"05:54","text":"Learning about the natural world is one thing; learning from the natural world -- that's the switch. That's the profound switch. What they realized was that the answers to their questions are everywhere; they just needed to change the lenses with which they saw the world. 3.8 billion years of field-testing. 10 to 30 -- Craig Venter will probably tell you; I think there's a lot more than 30 million -- well-adapted solutions. The important thing for me is that these are solutions solved in context. And the context is the Earth -- the same context that we're trying to solve our problems in. So it's the conscious emulation of life's genius. It's not slavishly mimicking -- although Al is trying to get the hairdo going -- it's not a slavish mimicry; it's taking the design principles, the genius of the natural world, and learning something from it. "},{"time":"06:56","text":"Now, in a group with so many IT people, I do have to mention what I'm not going to talk about, and that is that your field is one that has learned an enormous amount from living things, on the software side. So there's computers that protect themselves, like an immune system, and we're learning from gene regulation and biological development. And we're learning from neural nets, genetic algorithms, evolutionary computing. That's on the software side. But what's interesting to me is that we haven't looked at this, as much. I mean, these machines are really not very high tech in my estimation in the sense that there's dozens and dozens of carcinogens in the water in Silicon Valley. So the hardware is not at all up to snuff in terms of what life would call a success. So what can we learn about making -- not just computers, but everything? The plane you came in, cars, the seats that you're sitting on. How do we redesign the world that we make, the human-made world? More importantly, what should we ask in the next 10 years? And there's a lot of cool technologies out there that life has. "},{"time":"08:14","text":"What's the syllabus? Three questions, for me, are key. How does life make things? This is the opposite; this is how we make things. It's called heat, beat and treat -- that's what material scientists call it. And it's carving things down from the top, with 96 percent waste left over and only 4 percent product. You heat it up; you beat it with high pressures; you use chemicals. OK. Heat, beat and treat. "},{"time":"08:42","text":"Life can't afford to do that. How does life make things? How does life make the most of things? That's a geranium pollen. And its shape is what gives it the function of being able to tumble through air so easily. Look at that shape. Life adds information to matter. In other words: structure. It gives it information. By adding information to matter, it gives it a function that's different than without that structure. And thirdly, how does life make things disappear into systems? Because life doesn't really deal in things; there are no things in the natural world divorced from their systems. Really quick syllabus. As I'm reading more and more now, and following the story, there are some amazing things coming up in the biological sciences. And at the same time, I'm listening to a lot of businesses and finding what their sort of grand challenges are. The two groups are not talking to each other. At all. "},{"time":"10:00","text":"What in the world of biology might be helpful at this juncture, to get us through this sort of evolutionary knothole that we're in? I'm going to try to go through 12, really quickly. "},{"time":"10:12","text":"One that's exciting to me is self-assembly. Now, you've heard about this in terms of nanotechnology. Back to that shell: the shell is a self-assembling material. On the lower left there is a picture of mother of pearl forming out of seawater. It's a layered structure that's mineral and then polymer, and it makes it very, very tough. It's twice as tough as our high-tech ceramics. But what's really interesting: unlike our ceramics that are in kilns, it happens in seawater. It happens near, in and near, the organism's body. This is Sandia National Labs. A guy named Jeff Brinker has found a way to have a self-assembling coding process. Imagine being able to make ceramics at room temperature by simply dipping something into a liquid, lifting it out of the liquid, and having evaporation force the molecules in the liquid together, so that they jigsaw together in the same way as this crystallization works. Imagine making all of our hard materials that way. Imagine spraying the precursors to a PV cell, to a solar cell, onto a roof, and having it self-assemble into a layered structure that harvests light. "},{"time":"11:32","text":"Here's an interesting one for the IT world: bio-silicon. This is a diatom, which is made of silicates. And so silicon, which we make right now -- it's part of our carcinogenic problem in the manufacture of our chips -- this is a bio-mineralization process that's now being mimicked. This is at UC Santa Barbara. Look at these diatoms. This is from Ernst Haeckel's work. Imagine being able to -- and, again, it's a templated process, and it solidifies out of a liquid process -- imagine being able to have that sort of structure coming out at room temperature. Imagine being able to make perfect lenses. On the left, this is a brittle star; it's covered with lenses that the people at Lucent Technologies have found have no distortion whatsoever. It's one of the most distortion-free lenses we know of. And there's many of them, all over its entire body. What's interesting, again, is that it self-assembles. A woman named Joanna Aizenberg, at Lucent, is now learning to do this in a low-temperature process to create these sort of lenses. She's also looking at fiber optics. That's a sea sponge that has a fiber optic. Down at the very base of it, there's fiber optics that work better than ours, actually, to move light, but you can tie them in a knot; they're incredibly flexible. "},{"time":"13:02","text":"Here's another big idea: CO2 as a feedstock. A guy named Geoff Coates, at Cornell, said to himself, you know, plants do not see CO2 as the biggest poison of our time. We see it that way. Plants are busy making long chains of starches and glucose, right, out of CO2. He's found a way -- he's found a catalyst -- and he's found a way to take CO2 and make it into polycarbonates. Biodegradable plastics out of CO2 -- how plant-like. "},{"time":"13:31","text":"Solar transformations: the most exciting one. There are people who are mimicking the energy-harvesting device inside of purple bacterium, the people at ASU. Even more interesting, lately, in the last couple of weeks, people have seen that there's an enzyme called hydrogenase that's able to evolve hydrogen from proton and electrons, and is able to take hydrogen up -- basically what's happening in a fuel cell, in the anode of a fuel cell and in a reversible fuel cell. In our fuel cells, we do it with platinum; life does it with a very, very common iron. And a team has now just been able to mimic that hydrogen-juggling hydrogenase. That's very exciting for fuel cells -- to be able to do that without platinum. "},{"time":"14:22","text":"Power of shape: here's a whale. We've seen that the fins of this whale have tubercles on them. And those little bumps actually increase efficiency in, for instance, the edge of an airplane -- increase efficiency by about 32 percent. Which is an amazing fossil fuel savings, if we were to just put that on the edge of a wing. Color without pigments: this peacock is creating color with shape. Light comes through, it bounces back off the layers; it's called thin-film interference. Imagine being able to self-assemble products with the last few layers playing with light to create color. Imagine being able to create a shape on the outside of a surface, so that it's self-cleaning with just water. That's what a leaf does. See that up-close picture? That's a ball of water, and those are dirt particles. And that's an up-close picture of a lotus leaf. There's a company making a product called Lotusan, which mimics -- when the building facade paint dries, it mimics the bumps in a self-cleaning leaf, and rainwater cleans the building. "},{"time":"15:36","text":"Water is going to be our big, grand challenge: quenching thirst. Here are two organisms that pull water. The one on the left is the Namibian beetle pulling water out of fog. The one on the right is a pill bug -- pulls water out of air, does not drink fresh water. Pulling water out of Monterey fog and out of the sweaty air in Atlanta, before it gets into a building, are key technologies. "},{"time":"16:08","text":"Separation technologies are going to be extremely important. What if we were to say, no more hard rock mining? What if we were to separate out metals from waste streams, small amounts of metals in water? That's what microbes do; they chelate metals out of water. There's a company here in San Francisco called MR3 that is embedding mimics of the microbes' molecules on filters to mine waste streams. Green chemistry is chemistry in water. We do chemistry in organic solvents. This is a picture of the spinnerets coming out of a spider and the silk being formed from a spider. Isn't that beautiful? Green chemistry is replacing our industrial chemistry with nature's recipe book. It's not easy, because life uses only a subset of the elements in the periodic table. And we use all of them, even the toxic ones. To figure out the elegant recipes that would take the small subset of the periodic table, and create miracle materials like that cell, is the task of green chemistry. "},{"time":"17:27","text":"Timed degradation: packaging that is good until you don't want it to be good anymore, and dissolves on cue. That's a mussel you can find in the waters out here, and the threads holding it to a rock are timed; at exactly two years, they begin to dissolve. "},{"time":"17:44","text":"Healing: this is a good one. That little guy over there is a tardigrade. There is a problem with vaccines around the world not getting to patients. And the reason is that the refrigeration somehow gets broken; what's called the \"cold chain\" gets broken. A guy named Bruce Rosner looked at the tardigrade -- which dries out completely, and yet stays alive for months and months and months, and is able to regenerate itself. And he found a way to dry out vaccines -- encase them in the same sort of sugar capsules as the tardigrade has within its cells -- meaning that vaccines no longer need to be refrigerated. They can be put in a glove compartment, OK. Learning from organisms. This is a session about water -- learning about organisms that can do without water, in order to create a vaccine that lasts and lasts and lasts without refrigeration. "},{"time":"18:51","text":"I'm not going to get to 12. But what I am going to do is tell you that the most important thing, besides all of these adaptations, is the fact that these organisms have figured out a way to do the amazing things they do while taking care of the place that's going to take care of their offspring. When they're involved in foreplay, they're thinking about something very, very important -- and that's having their genetic material remain, 10,000 generations from now. And that means finding a way to do what they do without destroying the place that'll take care of their offspring. That's the biggest design challenge. Luckily, there are millions and millions of geniuses willing to gift us with their best ideas. Good luck having a conversation with them. "},{"time":"19:52","text":"Thank you.

There can be 80 million of them in a square kilometer, and yet they don't collide with one another. And yet we have 3.6 million car collisions a year. (Laughter) Right. There's a person at Newcastle who has figured out that it's a very large neuron. And she's actually figuring out how to make a collision-avoidance circuitry based on this very large neuron in the locust. "},{"time":"21:02","text":"This is a huge and important one, number 11. And that's the growing fertility. That means, you know, net fertility farming. We should be growing fertility. And, oh yes -- we get food, too. Because we have to grow the capacity of this planet to create more and more opportunities for life. And really, that's what other organisms do as well. In ensemble, that's what whole ecosystems do: they create more and more opportunities for life. Our farming has done the opposite. So, farming based on how a prairie builds soil, ranching based on how a native ungulate herd actually increases the health of the range, even wastewater treatment based on how a marsh not only cleans the water, but creates incredibly sparkling productivity. "},{"time":"21:54","text":"This is the simple design brief. I mean, it looks simple because the system, over 3.8 billion years, has worked this out. That is, those organisms that have not been able to figure out how to enhance or sweeten their places, are not around to tell us about it. That's the twelfth one. Life -- and this is the secret trick; this is the magic trick -- life creates conditions conducive to life. It builds soil; it cleans air; it cleans water; it mixes the cocktail of gases that you and I need to live. And it does that in the middle of having great foreplay and meeting their needs. So it's not mutually exclusive. We have to find a way to meet our needs, while making of this place an Eden. "},{"time":"22:54","text":"CA: Janine, thank you so much.

I've spent the past year thinking about what it really should be about. Should I be pro-technology? Should I embrace it full arms? Should I be wary? Like you, I'm very tempted by the latest thing. But at the other hand, a couple of years ago I gave up all of my possessions, sold all my technology -- except for a bicycle -- and rode across 3,000 miles on the U.S. back roads under the power of my one body, fuelled mostly by Twinkies and junk food. "},{"time":"00:38","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"00:39","text":"And I've since then tried to keep technology at arm's length in many ways, so it doesn't master my life. At the same time, I run a website on cool tools, where I issue a daily obsession of the latest things in technology. So I'm still perplexed about what the true meaning of technology is as it relates to humanity, as it relates to nature, as it relates to the spiritual. And I'm not even sure we know what technology is. And one definition of technology is that which is first recorded. This is the first example of the modern use of technology that I can find. It was the suggested syllabus for dealing with the Applied Arts and Science at Cambridge University in 1829. "},{"time":"01:31","text":"Before that, obviously, technology didn't exist. But obviously it did. I like one of the definitions that Alan Kay has for technology. He says technology is anything that was invented after you were born. "},{"time":"01:44","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"01:45","text":"So it sums up a lot of what we're talking about. Danny Hillis actually has an update on that -- he says technology is anything that doesn't quite work yet. "},{"time":"01:55","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"01:56","text":"Which also, I think, gets into a little bit of our current idea. But I was interested in another definition of technology. Something, again, that went back to something more fundamental. Something that was deeper. And as I struggled to understand that, I came up with a way of framing the question that seemed to work for me in my investigations. And I'm, this morning, going to talk about this for the first time. So this is a very rough attempt to think out loud. "},{"time":"02:27","text":"The question that I came up with was this question: what does technology want? And by that, I don't mean, does it want chocolate or vanilla? By what it wants, I mean, what are its inherent trends and biases? What are its tendencies over time? One way to think about this is thinking about biological organisms, which we've heard a lot about. And the trick that Richard Dawkins does, which is to say, to look at them as simply as genes, as vehicles for genes. So he's saying, what do genes want? The selfish gene. And I'm applying a similar trick to say, what if we looked at the universe in our culture through the eyes of technology? What does technology want? Obviously, this in an incomplete question, just as looking at an organism as only a gene is an incomplete way of looking at it. But it's still very, very productive. So I'm attempting to say, if we take technology's view of the world, what does it want? And I think once we ask that question we have to go back, actually, to life. Because obviously, if we keep extending the origins of technology far back, I think we come back to life at some point. "},{"time":"03:38","text":"So that's where I want to begin my little exploration, is in life. And like you heard from the previous speakers, we don't really know what life there is on Earth right now. We have really no idea. Craig Venter's tremendous and brilliant attempt to DNA sequence things in the ocean is great. Brian Farrell's work is all part of this agenda to try and actually discover all the species on Earth. And one of the things that we should do is just make a grid of the globe and randomly go and inspect all the places that the grid intersects, just to see what's on life. And if we did that with our little Martian probe, which we have not done on Earth, we would begin to see some incredible species. "},{"time":"04:18","text":"This is not on another planet. These are things that are hidden away on our planet. This is an ant that stores its colleagues' honey in its abdomen. Each one of these organisms that we've described -- that you've seen from Jamie and others, these magnificent things -- what they're doing, each one of them, is they're hacking the rules of life. I can't think of a single general principle of biology that does not have an exception somewhere by some organism. Every single thing that we can think of -- and if you heard Olivia's talk about the sexual habits, you'll realize that there isn't anything we can say that's true for all life, because every single one of them is hacking something about it. This is a solar-powered sea slug. It's a nudibranch that has incorporated chloroplast inside it to drive its energy. This is another version of that. This is a sea dragon, and the one on the bottom, the blue one, is a juvenile that has not yet swallowed the acid, has not yet taken in the brown-green algae pond scum into its body to give it energy. "},{"time":"05:27","text":"These are hacks, and if we looked at the general shape of the approaches to hacking life there are, current consensus, six kingdoms. Six different broad approaches: the plants, the animals, the fungi, the protests -- the little things -- the bacteria and the Archaea bacteria. The Archaeas. Those are the general approaches to life. That's one way to look at life on Earth today. "},{"time":"05:52","text":"But a more interesting way, the current way to take the long view, is to look at it in an evolutionary perspective. And here we have a view of evolution where rather than having evolution go over the linear time, we have it coming out from the center. So in the center is the most primitive, and this is a genealogical chart of all life on earth. This is all the same six kingdoms. You see 4,000 representative species, and you can see where we are. But what I like about this is it shows that every living organism on Earth today is equally evolved. Those fungi and bacteria are as highly evolved as humans. They've been around just as long and gone through just the same kind of trial and error to get here. But we see that each one of these is actually hacking, and has a different way of finding out how to do life. "},{"time":"06:45","text":"And if we take the long-term trends of life, if we begin to say, what does evolution want? There's several things that we see. One of the things about evolution is that nowhere on Earth have we ever been where we don't find life. We find life at the bottom of every long-term, long-distance drilling core into the center of rock that we bring up -- and there's bacteria in the pores of that rock. And wherever life is, it never retreats. It's ubiquitous and it wants to be more. More and more of the inert matter of the globe is being touched and animated by life. "},{"time":"07:23","text":"The second thing is is we see diversity. We also see specialization. We see the movement from a general-purpose cell to the more specific and specialized. And we see a drift towards complexity that's very intuitive. And actually, we have current data that does show that there is an actual drift towards complexity over time. And the last thing, I bring back this nudibranch. One of the things we see about life is that it moves from the inner to increasing sociability. And by that it means that there is more and more of life whose entire environment is other life. Like those chloroplast cells -- they're completely surrounded by other life. They never touch the inner matter. There is more and more co-evolution. And so the general, long-term trends of evolution are roughly these five: ubiquity, diversity, specialization, complexity and socialization. Now, I took that and said, OK, what are the long-term trends in technology? "},{"time":"08:23","text":"And again, my question is, what does technology want? And so, remarkably, I discovered that there's also a drift toward specialization. That we see there's a general hammer, and hammers become more and more specific over time. There's obviously diversity. Huge numbers of things. This is all the contents of a Japanese home. I actually had my daughter -- gave her a tally counter, and I gave her an assignment last summer to go around and count the number of species of technology in our household. And it came up with 6,000 different species of products. I did some research and found out that the King of England, Henry VIII, had only about 7,000 items in his household. And he was the King of England, and that was the entire wealth of England at the time. So we're seeing huge numbers of diversity in the kinds of things. "},{"time":"09:12","text":"This is a scene from Star Wars where the 3PO comes out and he sees machines making machines. How depraved! Well, this is actually what we're headed towards: world machines. And the technology is only being thrown out by other technologies. Most machines will only ever be in contact with other technology and not non-technology, or even life. "},{"time":"09:32","text":"And thirdly, the idea that machines are becoming biological and complex is at this point a cliche. And I'm happy to say, I was partly responsible for that cliche that machines are becoming biological, but that's pretty evident. So the major trends in technology evolution actually are the same as in biological evolution. The same drives that we see towards ubiquity, towards diversity, towards socialization, towards complexity. That is maybe not a big surprise because if we map out, say, the evolution of armor, you can actually follow a sort of an evolutionary-type cladistic tree. I suggest that, in fact, technology is the seventh kingdom of life. That its operations and how it works is so similar that we can think of it as the seventh kingdom. And so it would be sort of approximately up there, coming out of the animal kingdom. And if we were to do that, we would find out -- we could actually approach technology in this way.

But the most interesting aspect about this is that if you look at those red lines at the bottom, those indicate basically a parentage of a type of cornet that was no longer made. That does not happen in biology. When something is extinct, you can't have it as your parent. But that does happen in technology. And it turns out that that's so distinctive that you can actually look at this tree, and you can actually use it to determine that this is a technological system versus a biological system. "},{"time":"11:35","text":"In fact, this idea of resurrecting the whole idea is so important that I began to think about what happens with old technology. And it turns out that, in fact, technologies don't die. So I suggested this to an historian of science, and he said, \"Well, what about, you know, come on, what about steam cars? They're not around anymore.\" Well actually, they are. In fact, they're so around that you can buy new parts for a Stanley steam automobile. And this is a website of a guy who's selling brand new parts for the Stanley automobile. And the thing that I liked is sort of this one-click, add-to-your-cart button -- "},{"time":"12:16","text":"(Laughter) -- "},{"time":"12:17","text":"for buying steam valves. I mean, it was just -- it was really there. And so, I began to think about, well, maybe that's just a random sample. Maybe I should do this sort of in a more conservative way. "},{"time":"12:30","text":"So I took the great big 1895 Montgomery Ward's catalog and I randomly went through it. And I took a page -- not quite a random page -- I took a page that was actually more difficult than others because lots of the pages are filled with things that are still being made. But I took this page and I said, how many of these things are still being made? And not antiques. I want to know how many of these things are still in production. And the answer is: all of them. All of them are still being produced. So you've got corn shellers. I don't know who needs a corn sheller. Be it corn shellers -- you've got ploughs; you've got fan mills; all these things -- and these are not, again, antiques. These are -- you can order these. You can go to the web and you can buy them now, brand-new made. So in a certain sense, technologies don't die. In fact, you can buy, for 50 bucks, a stone-age knife made exactly the same way that they were made 10,000 years ago. It's short, bone handle, 50 bucks. And in fact, what's important is that this information actually never died out. It's not just that it was resurrected. It's continued all along. And in Papua New Guinea, they were making stone axes until two decades ago, just as a course of practical matters. "},{"time":"13:52","text":"Even when we try to get rid of a technology, it's actually very hard. So we've all heard about the Amish giving up cars. We've heard about the Japanese giving up guns. We've heard about this and that. But I actually went back and took what I could find, the examples in history where there have been prohibitions against technology, and then I tried to find out when they came back in, because they always came back in. And it turns out that the time, the duration of when they were outlawed and prohibited, is decreasing over time. And that basically, you can delay technology, but you can't kill it. So this makes sense, because in a certain sense what culture is, is the accumulation of ideas. That's what it's for. It's so that ideas don't die out. And when we take that, we take this idea of what culture is doing and add it to what the long-term trajectory -- again, in life's evolution -- we find that each case -- each of the major transitions in life -- what they're really about is accelerating and changing the way in which evolution happens. They're actually changing the way in which ideas are generated. "},{"time":"14:58","text":"So all these steps in evolution are increasing, basically, the evolution of evolvability. So what's happening over time in life is that the ways in which you generate these new ideas, these new hacks, are increasing. And the real tricks are ways in which you kind of explore the way of exploring. And then what we see in the singularity, that prophesized by Kurzweil and others -- his idea that technology is accelerating evolution. It's accelerating the way in which we search for ideas. So if you have life hacking -- life means hacking, the game of survival -- then evolution is a way to extend the game by changing the rules of the game. And what technology is really about is better ways to evolve. That is what we call an \"infinite game.\" That's the definition of \"infinite game.\" A finite game is play to win, and an infinite game is played to keep playing. And I believe that technology is actually a cosmic force. "},{"time":"15:55","text":"The origins of technology was not in 1829, but was actually at the beginning of the Big Bang, and at that moment the entire huge billions of stars in the universe were compressed. The entire universe was compressed into a little quantum dot, and it was so tight in there, there was no room for any difference at all. That's the definition. There was no temperature. There was no difference whatsoever. And at the Big Bang, what it expanded was the potential for difference. So as it expands and as things expand what we have is the potential for differences, diversity, options, choices, opportunities, possibilities and freedoms. Those are all basically the same thing. And those are the things that technology brings us. That's what technology is bringing us: choices, possibilities, freedoms. That's what it's about. It's this expansion of room to make differences. And so a hammer, when we grab a hammer, that's what we're grabbing. And that's why we continue to grab technology -- because we want those things. Those things are good. Differences, freedom, choices, possibilities. And each time we make a new opportunity place, we're allowing a platform to make new ones. "},{"time":"17:03","text":"And I think it's really important. Because if you can imagine Mozart before the technology of the piano was invented -- what a loss to society there would be. Imagine Van Gogh being born before the technologies of cheap oil paints. Imagine Hitchcock before the technologies of film. Somewhere, today, there are millions of young children being born whose technology of self-expression has not yet been invented. We have a moral obligation to invent technology so that every person on the globe has the potential to realize their true difference. We want a trillion zillion species of one individuals. That's what technology really wants. "},{"time":"17:44","text":"I'm going to skip through some of the objections because I don't have answers to why there's deforestation. I don't have an answer to the fact that there seem to be bad technologies. I don't have an answer to how this impacts on our dignity, other than to suggest that maybe the seventh kingdom, because it's so close to what life is about, maybe we can bring it back and have it help us monitor life. Maybe in some ways the fact that what we're trying to do with technology is find a good home for it. It's a terrible thing to spray DDT on cotton fields, but it's a really good thing to use to eliminate millions of cases of death due to malaria in a small village. "},{"time":"18:24","text":"Our humanity is actually defined by technology. All the things that we think that we really like about humanity is being driven by technology. This is the infinite game. That's what we're talking about. You see, technology is a way to evolve the evolution. It's a way to explore possibilities and opportunities and create more. And it's actually a way of playing the game, of playing all the games. That's what technology wants. And so when I think about what technology wants, I think that it has to do with the fact that every person here -- and I really believe this -- every person here has an assignment. And your assignment is to spend your life discovering what your assignment is. That recursive nature is the infinite game. And if you play that well, you'll have other people involved, so even that game extends and continues even when you're gone. That is the infinite game. And what technology is is the medium in which we play that infinite game. And so I think that we should embrace technology because it is an essential part of our journey in finding out who we are.

So I decided instead,\nI would talk about someone who I think has done as much\nto make Americans happy as perhaps anyone over the last 20 years, a man who is a great\npersonal hero of mine: someone by the name of Howard Moskowitz, who is most famous\nfor reinventing spaghetti sauce. "},{"time":"00:45","text":"Howard's about this high, and he's round, and he's in his 60s,\nand he has big huge glasses and thinning gray hair, and he has a kind of wonderful\nexuberance and vitality, and he has a parrot,\nand he loves the opera, and he's a great aficionado\nof medieval history. And by profession, he's a psychophysicist. Now, I should tell you that I have no idea\nwhat psychophysics is, although at some point in my life, I dated a girl for two years who was getting\nher doctorate in psychophysics. Which should tell you something\nabout that relationship. "},{"time":"01:24","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"01:26","text":"As far as I know, psychophysics\nis about measuring things. And Howard is very interested\nin measuring things. And he graduated\nwith his doctorate from Harvard, and he set up a little consulting shop\nin White Plains, New York. And one of his first clients was Pepsi. This is many years ago,\nback in the early 70s. And Pepsi came to Howard and they said, \"You know, there's this new\nthing called aspartame, and we would like to make Diet Pepsi. We'd like you to figure out how much aspartame we should put\nin each can of Diet Pepsi in order to have the perfect drink.\" Now that sounds like an incredibly\nstraightforward question to answer, and that's what Howard thought. Because Pepsi told him, \"We're working with a band\nbetween eight and 12 percent. Anything below eight percent\nsweetness is not sweet enough; anything above 12 percent\nsweetness is too sweet. We want to know: what's the sweet\nspot between 8 and 12?\" Now, if I gave you this problem to do,\nyou would all say, it's very simple. What we do is you make up\na big experimental batch of Pepsi, at every degree of sweetness --\neight percent, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, all the way up to 12 -- and we try this out\nwith thousands of people, and we plot the results on a curve, and we take the most popular\nconcentration, right? Really simple. "},{"time":"02:41","text":"Howard does the experiment,\nand he gets the data back, and he plots it on a curve, and all of a sudden he realizes\nit's not a nice bell curve. In fact, the data doesn't make any sense. It's a mess. It's all over the place. Now, most people in that business,\nin the world of testing food and such, are not dismayed\nwhen the data comes back a mess. They think, \"Well, you know, figuring out what people think\nabout cola's not that easy.\" \"You know, maybe we made an error\nsomewhere along the way.\" \"You know, let's just\nmake an educated guess,\" and they simply point\nand they go for 10 percent, right in the middle. Howard is not so easily placated. Howard is a man of a certain degree\nof intellectual standards. And this was not good enough for him, and this question bedeviled him for years. And he would think it through\nand say, \"What was wrong? Why could we not make sense\nof this experiment with Diet Pepsi?\" "},{"time":"03:30","text":"And one day, he was sitting\nin a diner in White Plains, about to go trying to dream up\nsome work for Nescafé. And suddenly, like a bolt of lightning,\nthe answer came to him. And that is, that when they analyzed\nthe Diet Pepsi data, they were asking the wrong question. They were looking for the perfect Pepsi, and they should have been\nlooking for the perfect Pepsis. Trust me. This was an enormous revelation. This was one of the most brilliant\nbreakthroughs in all of food science. Howard immediately went on the road, and he would go to conferences\naround the country, and he would stand up and say, \"You had been looking\nfor the perfect Pepsi. You're wrong. You should be looking\nfor the perfect Pepsis.\" And people would look at him\nblankly and say, \"What are you talking about? Craziness.\" And they would say, \"Move! Next!\" Tried to get business,\nnobody would hire him -- he was obsessed, though, and he talked about it\nand talked about it. Howard loves the Yiddish expression \"To a worm in horseradish,\nthe world is horseradish.\" This was his horseradish. "},{"time":"04:28","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"04:29","text":"He was obsessed with it! "},{"time":"04:32","text":"And finally, he had a breakthrough. Vlasic Pickles came to him, and they said, \"Doctor Moskowitz,\nwe want to make the perfect pickle.\" And he said, \"There is no perfect pickle;\nthere are only perfect pickles.\" And he came back to them and he said, \"You don't just need\nto improve your regular; you need to create zesty.\" And that's where we got zesty pickles. Then the next person came to him:\nCampbell's Soup. And this was even more important. "},{"time":"04:59","text":"In fact, Campbell's Soup\nis where Howard made his reputation. Campbell's made Prego, and Prego, in the early 80s,\nwas struggling next to Ragù, which was the dominant\nspaghetti sauce of the 70s and 80s. In the industry -- I don't\nknow whether you care about this, or how much time I have to go into this. But it was, technically speaking\n-- this is an aside -- Prego is a better tomato sauce than Ragù. The quality of the tomato paste\nis much better; the spice mix is far superior; it adheres to the pasta\nin a much more pleasing way. In fact, they would do\nthe famous bowl test back in the 70s with Ragù and Prego. You'd have a plate of spaghetti,\nand you would pour it on, right? And the Ragù would all go to the bottom,\nand the Prego would sit on top. That's called \"adherence.\" And, anyway, despite the fact\nthat they were far superior in adherence, and the quality of their tomato paste, Prego was struggling. "},{"time":"05:51","text":"So they came to Howard,\nand they said, fix us. And Howard looked\nat their product line, and he said, what you have is a dead tomato society. So he said, this is what I want to do. And he got together\nwith the Campbell's soup kitchen, and he made 45 varieties\nof spaghetti sauce. And he varied them according\nto every conceivable way that you can vary tomato sauce: by sweetness, by level of garlic, by tomatoey-ness,\nby tartness, by sourness, by visible solids -- my favorite term\nin the spaghetti sauce business. "},{"time":"06:23","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"06:24","text":"Every conceivable way\nyou can vary spaghetti sauce, he varied spaghetti sauce. And then he took this whole raft\nof 45 spaghetti sauces, and he went on the road. He went to New York, to Chicago, he went to Jacksonville, to Los Angeles. And he brought in people\nby the truckload into big halls. And he sat them down for two hours, and over the course of that two hours,\nhe gave them ten bowls. Ten small bowls of pasta, with a different spaghetti\nsauce on each one. And after they ate each bowl,\nthey had to rate, from 0 to 100, how good they thought\nthe spaghetti sauce was. "},{"time":"06:59","text":"At the end of that process,\nafter doing it for months and months, he had a mountain of data about how the American people\nfeel about spaghetti sauce. And then he analyzed the data. Did he look for the most popular\nvariety of spaghetti sauce? No! Howard doesn't believe\nthat there is such a thing. Instead, he looked\nat the data, and he said, let's see if we can group all these\ndifferent data points into clusters. Let's see if they congregate\naround certain ideas. And sure enough, if you sit down, and you analyze all this data\non spaghetti sauce, you realize that all Americans\nfall into one of three groups. There are people\nwho like their spaghetti sauce plain; there are people\nwho like their spaghetti sauce spicy; and there are people\nwho like it extra chunky. "},{"time":"07:44","text":"And of those three facts,\nthe third one was the most significant, because at the time, in the early 1980s, if you went to a supermarket, you would not find\nextra-chunky spaghetti sauce. And Prego turned to Howard, and they said, \"You're telling me\nthat one third of Americans crave extra-chunky spaghetti sauce and yet no one is servicing their needs?\" And he said \"Yes!\" "},{"time":"08:08","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"08:09","text":"And Prego then went back, and completely reformulated\ntheir spaghetti sauce, and came out with a line of extra chunky\nthat immediately and completely took over the spaghetti sauce\nbusiness in this country. And over the next 10 years,\nthey made 600 million dollars off their line of extra-chunky sauces. "},{"time":"08:28","text":"Everyone else in the industry looked\nat what Howard had done, and they said, \"Oh my god! We've been\nthinking all wrong!\" And that's when you started to get\nseven different kinds of vinegar, and 14 different kinds of mustard,\nand 71 different kinds of olive oil. And then eventually\neven Ragù hired Howard, and Howard did the exact same thing\nfor Ragù that he did for Prego. And today, if you go\nto a really good supermarket, do you know how many Ragùs there are? 36! In six varieties: Cheese, Light, Robusto, Rich &amp; Hearty, Old World Traditional -- Extra-Chunky Garden. "},{"time":"09:09","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"09:11","text":"That's Howard's doing. That is Howard's gift\nto the American people. "},{"time":"09:15","text":"Now why is that important? "},{"time":"09:16","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"09:19","text":"It is, in fact, enormously important. I'll explain to you why. What Howard did is he fundamentally\nchanged the way the food industry thinks about making you happy. Assumption number one\nin the food industry used to be that the way to find out\nwhat people want to eat, what will make people happy,\nis to ask them. And for years and years and years, Ragù and Prego would have focus groups, and they would sit you down,\nand they would say, \"What do you want in a spaghetti sauce? Tell us what you want\nin a spaghetti sauce.\" And for all those years -- 20, 30 years -- through all those focus group sessions, no one ever said they wanted extra-chunky. Even though at least a third of them,\ndeep in their hearts, actually did. "},{"time":"10:00","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"10:02","text":"People don't know what they want! As Howard loves to say, \"The mind knows not\nwhat the tongue wants.\" It's a mystery! "},{"time":"10:10","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"10:11","text":"And a critically important step in understanding\nour own desires and tastes is to realize that we cannot always\nexplain what we want, deep down. If I asked all of you, for example,\nin this room, what you want in a coffee, you know what you'd say? Every one of you would say,\n\"I want a dark, rich, hearty roast.\" It's what people always say\nwhen you ask them. \"What do you like?\"\n\"Dark, rich, hearty roast!\" What percentage of you actually\nlike a dark, rich, hearty roast? According to Howard, somewhere\nbetween 25 and 27 percent of you. Most of you like milky, weak coffee. "},{"time":"10:45","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"10:46","text":"But you will never, ever say\nto someone who asks you what you want that \"I want a milky, weak coffee.\" "},{"time":"10:52","text":"So that's number one thing\nthat Howard did. Number two thing that Howard did\nis he made us realize -- it's another very critical point -- he made us realize the importance of what he likes to call\n\"horizontal segmentation.\" Why is this critical? Because this is the way the food industry\nthought before Howard. What were they obsessed with\nin the early 80s? They were obsessed with mustard. In particular, they were obsessed\nwith the story of Grey Poupon. Used to be, there were two mustards:\nFrench's and Gulden's. What were they? Yellow mustard. What's in it? Yellow mustard seeds,\nturmeric, and paprika. That was mustard. Grey Poupon came along, with a Dijon. Right? Much more volatile brown mustard seed,\nsome white wine, a nose hit, much more delicate aromatics. And what do they do? They put it in a little tiny glass jar,\nwith a wonderful enameled label on it, made it look French, even though it's made\nin Oxnard, California. "},{"time":"11:49","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"11:50","text":"And instead of charging a dollar fifty\nfor the eight-ounce bottle, the way that French's and Gulden's did, they decided to charge four dollars. And they had those ads. With the guy in the Rolls Royce,\neating the Grey Poupon. Another pulls up, and says,\n\"Do you have any Grey Poupon?\" And the whole thing, after they did that,\nGrey Poupon takes off! Takes over the mustard business! "},{"time":"12:10","text":"And everyone's take-home lesson from that was that the way to make people happy is to give them something\nthat is more expensive, something to aspire to. It's to make them turn their back\non what they think they like now, and reach out for something\nhigher up the mustard hierarchy. "},{"time":"12:30","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"12:31","text":"A better mustard!\nA more expensive mustard! A mustard of more sophistication\nand culture and meaning. And Howard looked to that\nand said, \"That's wrong!\" Mustard does not exist on a hierarchy. Mustard exists, just like tomato sauce,\non a horizontal plane. There is no good mustard or bad mustard. There is no perfect mustard\nor imperfect mustard. There are only different kinds of mustards\nthat suit different kinds of people. He fundamentally democratized\nthe way we think about taste. And for that, as well, we owe\nHoward Moskowitz a huge vote of thanks. "},{"time":"13:06","text":"Third thing that Howard did,\nand perhaps the most important, is Howard confronted the notion\nof the Platonic dish. "},{"time":"13:12","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"13:13","text":"What do I mean by that? "},{"time":"13:14","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"13:16","text":"For the longest time in the food industry, there was a sense that there was one way, a perfect way, to make a dish. You go to Chez Panisse, they give you the red-tail sashimi\nwith roasted pumpkin seeds in a something something reduction. They don't give you five options\non the reduction. They don't say, \"Do you want\nthe extra-chunky reduction, or ...?\" No! You just get the reduction. Why? Because the chef at Chez Panisse has a Platonic notion\nabout red-tail sashimi. \"This is the way it ought to be.\" And she serves it that way\ntime and time again, and if you quarrel with her, she will say, \"You know what? You're wrong! This is the best way it ought to be\nin this restaurant.\" "},{"time":"14:00","text":"Now that same idea fueled\nthe commercial food industry as well. They had a Platonic notion\nof what tomato sauce was. And where did that come from?\nIt came from Italy. Italian tomato sauce is what? It's blended; it's thin. The culture of tomato sauce was thin. When we talked about \"authentic\ntomato sauce\" in the 1970s, we talked about Italian tomato sauce, we talked about the earliest Ragùs, which had no visible solids, right? Which were thin, you just put a little bit and it sunk down to the bottom\nof the pasta. That's what it was. And why were we attached to that? Because we thought\nthat what it took to make people happy was to provide them with the most\nculturally authentic tomato sauce, A. And B, we thought that if we gave them\nthe culturally authentic tomato sauce, then they would embrace it. And that's what would please\nthe maximum number of people. "},{"time":"14:50","text":"In other words, people in the cooking world\nwere looking for cooking universals. They were looking for one way\nto treat all of us. And it's good reason for them\nto be obsessed with the idea of universals, because all of science, through the 19th century\nand much of the 20th, was obsessed with universals. Psychologists, medical scientists,\neconomists were all interested\nin finding out the rules that govern the way all of us behave. But that changed, right? What is the great revolution\nin science of the last 10, 15 years? It is the movement\nfrom the search for universals to the understanding of variability. Now in medical science,\nwe don't want to know, necessarily, just how cancer works, we want to know how your cancer\nis different from my cancer. I guess my cancer different\nfrom your cancer. Genetics has opened the door\nto the study of human variability. What Howard Moskowitz\nwas doing was saying, \"This same revolution needs to happen\nin the world of tomato sauce.\" And for that, we owe him\na great vote of thanks. "},{"time":"15:55","text":"I'll give you one last\nillustration of variability, and that is -- oh, I'm sorry. Howard not only believed that,\nbut he took it a second step, which was to say that when we pursue\nuniversal principles in food, we aren't just making an error; we are actually doing ourselves\na massive disservice. And the example he used was coffee. And coffee is something he did\na lot of work with, with Nescafé. If I were to ask all of you to try\nand come up with a brand of coffee -- a type of coffee, a brew --\nthat made all of you happy, and then I asked you to rate that coffee, the average score in this room for coffee\nwould be about 60 on a scale of 0 to 100. If, however, you allowed me\nto break you into coffee clusters, maybe three or four coffee clusters, and I could make coffee just\nfor each of those individual clusters, your scores would go from 60 to 75 or 78. The difference between coffee\nat 60 and coffee at 78 is a difference between coffee\nthat makes you wince, and coffee that makes you\ndeliriously happy. "},{"time":"16:59","text":"That is the final, and I think\nmost beautiful lesson, of Howard Moskowitz: that in embracing the diversity\nof human beings, we will find a surer way\nto true happiness.

"},{"time":"09:06","text":"So, blogs. So what? You've probably\nheard these things before. We talked about the WELL,\nand about all these sorts of things throughout our online history. But I think blogs are basically\njust an evolution, and that's where we are today. It's this record\nof who you are, your persona. You have your Google search,\nwhere you say, \"What is Mena Trott?\" And then you find these things\nand you're happy or unhappy. But then you also find people's blogs, and those are the records of people\nthat are writing daily -- not necessarily about the same topic,\nbut things that interest them. And we talk about the world\nflattens, being in this panel, and I am very optimistic --\nwhenever I think about blogs, I'm like, \"We've got to reach\nall these people.\" Hundreds of millions\nand billions of people. We're getting into China,\nwe want to be there, but there are so many people that\nwon't have the access to write a blog. But to see something\nlike the $100 computer is amazing, because blogging software is simple. We have a successful company\nbecause of timing, and because of perseverance,\nbut it's simple stuff -- it's not rocket science. And so, that's an amazing\nthing to consider. So -- the life record of a blog is something\nthat I find incredibly important. "},{"time":"10:19","text":"And we started with a slide of my Teds, and I had to add this slide, because I knew the minute\nI showed this, my mom -- my mom will see this,\nbecause she does read my blog and she'll say, \"Why wasn't there\na picture of me?\" This is my mom. So, I have all the people that I know of. But this is basically the extent\nof the family that I know in terms of my direct line. I showed a Norman Rockwell painting\nbefore, and this one, I grew up with, looking at constantly. I would spend hours\nlooking at the connections, saying, \"Oh, the little kid\nup at the top has red hair; so does that first generation up there.\" And it's just these little things. This is not science,\nbut this was enough for me to be really interested\nin how we have evolved and how we can trace our line. So that has always influenced me.

And it's pretty sad, because I only go back\nfive generations, and that's it. I don't even know what happens\non my mom's side, because she's from Cuba\nand I don't have that many things. Just doing this,\nI spent time in the archives -- that's why my husband's a saint -- I spent time in the Washington archives, just sitting there,\nlooking for these things.

"},{"time":"12:09","text":"Another photo that has\ngreatly influenced me, or a series of photos, is this project that's done by an Argentinean\nman and his wife.

So I do something\nthat's very narcissistic -- "},{"time":"13:07","text":"I am a blogger -- that is an amazing thing for me, because it captures\na moment in time every day. I take a picture of myself --\nI've been doing this since last year -- every single day. And, you know, it's the same picture; it's basically the same person. "},{"time":"13:22","text":"Only a couple of people read it. I don't write this for this audience; I'm showing it now, but I would go\ninsane if this was really public. About four people probably read it, and they tell me, \"You haven't updated.\" I'm probably going to get people\ntelling me I haven't updated. But this is amazing, because I can\ngo back to a day -- to April 2005, and say, what was I doing this day? I look at it, I know exactly. It's this visual cue\nthat is so important to what we do. I put the bad pictures up too, because there are bad pictures. "},{"time":"13:51","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"13:52","text":"And I remember instantly:\nI am in Germany in this -- I had to go for a one-day trip. I was sick, and I was in a hotel room, and I wanted not to be there. And so you see these things,\nit's not just always smiling. Now I've kind of evolved it,\nso I have this look. If you look at my driver's license,\nI have the same look, and it's a pretty disturbing thing, but it's something\nthat is really important. "},{"time":"14:16","text":"And the last story\nI really want to tell is this story, because this is probably the one\nthat means the most to me in all of what I'm doing. I'll probably get choked up,\nbecause I tend to when I talk about this. So, this woman, her name was Emma, and she was a blogger\non our service, TypePad. And she was a beta tester,\nso she was there right when we opened -- you know, there was 100 people. And she wrote about her life\ndealing with cancer. She was writing and writing,\nand we all started reading it, because we had\nso few blogs on the service, we could keep track of everyone. "},{"time":"14:49","text":"And she was writing one day, and then she disappeared for a little bit. And her sister came on, and she said\nthat Emma had passed away. And all of our support staff who had\ntalked to her were really emotional, and it was a very hard day at the company. "},{"time":"15:06","text":"And this was one of those\ninstances where I realized how much blogging\naffects our relationship, and flattening this sort of world. That this woman is in England, and she lives -- she lived -- a life where she was talking\nabout what she was doing. But the big thing\nthat really influenced us was, her sister wrote to me, and she said -- and she wrote on this blog -- that writing her blog during\nthe last couple of months of her life was probably the best thing\nthat had happened to her, and being able to talk to people\nand to share what was going on, and being able to write\nand receive comments. And that was amazing, to be able to know\nthat we had empowered that, and that blogging was something\nthat she felt comfortable doing, and the idea that blogging\ndoesn't have to be scary, that we don't always have\nto be attack of the blogs, that we can be people who are open,\nand wanting to help and talk to people. That was an amazing thing. "},{"time":"15:59","text":"And so I printed out and sent\na PDF of her blog to her family, and they passed it\nout at her memorial service, and even in her obituary,\nthey mentioned her blog, because it was such\na big part of her life. And that's a huge thing. "},{"time":"16:12","text":"So, this is her legacy, and I think that my call to action\nto all of you is: think about blogs,\nthink about what they are, think about what you've thought of them, and then actually do it, because it's something\nthat's really going to change our lives.

About four people probably read it, and they tell me, \"You haven't updated.\" I'm probably going to get people\ntelling me I haven't updated.

And she was a beta tester,\nso she was there right when we opened -- you know, there was 100 people. And she wrote about her life\ndealing with cancer. She was writing and writing,\nand we all started reading it, because we had\nso few blogs on the service, we could keep track of everyone. "},{"time":"14:49","text":"And she was writing one day, and then she disappeared for a little bit. And her sister came on, and she said\nthat Emma had passed away. And all of our support staff who had\ntalked to her were really emotional, and it was a very hard day at the company. "},{"time":"15:06","text":"And this was one of those\ninstances where I realized how much blogging\naffects our relationship, and flattening this sort of world. That this woman is in England, and she lives -- she lived -- a life where she was talking\nabout what she was doing. But the big thing\nthat really influenced us was, her sister wrote to me, and she said -- and she wrote on this blog -- that writing her blog during\nthe last couple of months of her life was probably the best thing\nthat had happened to her, and being able to talk to people\nand to share what was going on, and being able to write\nand receive comments. And that was amazing, to be able to know\nthat we had empowered that, and that blogging was something\nthat she felt comfortable doing, and the idea that blogging\ndoesn't have to be scary, that we don't always have\nto be attack of the blogs, that we can be people who are open,\nand wanting to help and talk to people. That was an amazing thing. "},{"time":"15:59","text":"And so I printed out and sent\na PDF of her blog to her family, and they passed it\nout at her memorial service, and even in her obituary,\nthey mentioned her blog, because it was such\na big part of her life.

"},{"time":"04:58","text":"On a more serious note, in all of science\nwe're looking for a balance between data and theory. In the case of Galileo,\nhe had two problems when he turned his telescope to Saturn. First of all, there was no\ntheory of planetary rings. Second of all, his data\nwas grainy and fuzzy, and he couldn't quite make out\nwhat he was looking at. So he wrote that he had seen -- \"I have observed that the furthest\nplanet has three bodies.\" And this is what he ended up\nconcluding that he saw. So without a theory of planetary\nrings and with only grainy data, you can't have a good theory. It wasn't solved until 1655. "},{"time":"05:33","text":"This is Christiaan Huygens's book\nthat catalogs all the mistakes people made trying to figure out\nwhat was going on with Saturn. It wasn't till Huygens had two things: He had a good theory of planetary rings\nand how the solar system operated, and he had better telescopic,\nmore fine-grain data in which he could figure out that\nas the Earth is going around faster -- according to Kepler's Laws --\nthan Saturn, then we catch up with it. And we see the angles of the rings\nat different angles, there. And that, in fact, turns out to be true. "},{"time":"06:01","text":"The problem with having a theory is that\nit may be loaded with cognitive biases. So one of the problems of explaining\nwhy people believe weird things is that we have things, on a simple level, and then I'll go to more serious ones. Like, we have a tendency to see faces. "},{"time":"06:15","text":"This is the face on Mars. In 1976, where there was a whole movement\nto get NASA to photograph that area because people thought this was monumental\narchitecture made by Martians. Here's the close-up of it from 2001.

And if I didn't tell you what to look for,\nyou'd still see the face, because we're programmed\nby evolution to see faces. "},{"time":"06:43","text":"Faces are important for us socially.

And 30 years later I was sitting in an airplane, next to a lady called Veronica, who came from Chile, and we were on a human rights tour, and she was starting to tell me what it was like to be tortured, and, from my very privileged position, this was the only reference point that I had.

And Reebok set up a foundation after these Human Rights Now tours and there was a decision then -- well, we made a proposal, for a couple of years, about trying to set up a division that was going to give cameras to human rights activists.

"},{"time":"08:42","text":"And, I think, if we look around the world, as well as the polar ice caps melting, human rights, which have been fought for, for many hundreds of years in some cases, are, also, eroding very fast, and that is something that we need to take a look at and, maybe, start campaigning for. I mean, here, too, one of our partners was at Van Jones and the Books Not Bars project -- they have managed, with their footage in California to change the youth correction systems employed, and it's much -- much -- I think, more humane methods are being looked at, how you should lock up young kids, and that's questionable to start off. And as the story of Mr. Morales, just down the road, excuse me, Mr. Gabriel, would you mind if we delayed your execution a little bit? No, not at all, no problem, take your time. But this, surely, whoever that man is, whatever he's done, this is cruel and unusual punishment. "},{"time":"09:58","text":"Anyway, WITNESS has been trying to arm the brave people who often put their lives at risk around the world, with cameras, and I'd like to show you just a little more of that.

And we've also been trying to get computers out to the world, so that groups can communicate much more effectively, campaign much more effectively, but now we have the wonderful possibility, which is given to us from the mobile phone with the camera in it, because that is cheap; it's ubiquitous; and it's moving fast all around the world -- and it's very exciting for us. "},{"time":"12:33","text":"And so, the dream is that we could have a world in which anyone who has anything bad happen to them of this sort has a chance of getting their story uploaded, being seen, being watched, that they really know that they can be heard, that there would be a giant website, maybe, a little like Google Earth, and you could fly over and find out the realities of what's going, for the world's inhabitants. In a way what this technology is allowing is, really, that a lot of the problems of the world can have a human face, that we can actually see who's dying of AIDS or who's being beaten up, for the first time, and we can hear their stories in a way that the blogger culture -- if we can move that into these sort of fields, I think we can really transform the world in all sorts of ways. There could be a new movement growing up, rising from the ground, reaching for the light, and growing strong, just like a tree. Thank you.

So many different points of resonance that it's going to be difficult\nto bring them all up, but I'll try to do my best. Does anybody remember these? "},{"time":"00:17","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"00:19","text":"OK, so these are LP records\nand they've been replaced, right? They've been swept away\nover the last two decades by these types of world-flattening\ndigitization technologies, right? And I think it was best witnessed when Thomas was playing the music\nas we came in the room today. What's happened in the music world\nis there's a culture, or an ecosystem that's been created that, if you take some words from Apple, the catchphrase --\nthat we create, rip, mix and burn. What I mean by that is that anyone\nin the world is free and allowed to create new music and musical ideas. Anyone in the world is allowed\nto rip or copy musical ideas, use them in innovative ways. Anyone is allowed to mix them\nin different types of ways, draw connections between musical ideas, and people can burn them or create\nfinal products and continue the circle. And what that's done\nis it's created, like I said, a vibrant community that's very inclusive, with people continually working\nto connect musical ideas, innovate them and keep things\nconstantly up to date. Today's hit single\nis not last year's hit single. "},{"time":"01:26","text":"But I'm not here\nto talk about music today. I'm here to talk about books. In particular, textbooks\nand the kind of educational materials that we use every day in school. Has anyone here ever been to school? "},{"time":"01:37","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"01:38","text":"OK, does anybody realize\nthere's a crisis in our schools, around the world? I'm not going to spend\ntoo much time on that, but what I want to talk about\nis some of the disconnects that appear when an author\npublishes a book. That in fact, the publishing process -- just because of the fact\nthat it's complicated, it's heavy, books are expensive -- creates a sort of a wall\nbetween authors of books and the ultimate users of books, be they teachers, students\nor just general readers. And this is even more true\nif you happen to speak a language other than one of the world's\nmajor languages, and especially English. I'm going to call these people\nbelow the barrier \"shutouts\" because they're really\nshut out of the process of being able to share\ntheir knowledge with the world. And so what I want to talk about today\nis trying to take these ideas that we've seen in the musical culture and try to bring these\ntowards reinventing the way we think about writing books,\nusing them and teaching from them. So, that's what I'd like to talk about and, really, how we get\nfrom where we are now to where we need to go. "},{"time":"02:39","text":"The first thing I'd like you to do\nis a little thought experiment. Imagine taking all the world's books. OK, everybody imagine books\nand imagine just tearing out the pages. So, liberating these pages and imagine digitizing them\nand then storing them in a vast, interconnected,\nglobal repository. Think of it as a massive iTunes\nfor book-type content. And then take that material\nand imagine making it all open, so that people can modify it,\nplay with it, improve it. Imagine making it free, so that anyone in the world can have\naccess to all of this knowledge, and imagine using information technology so that you can update this content,\nimprove it, play with it, on a timescale that's more\non the order of seconds instead of years. Instead of editions of a book\ncoming out every two years, imagine them coming out every 25 seconds. "},{"time":"03:28","text":"So, imagine we could do that\nand imagine we could put people into this. So that we could truly build\nan ecosystem with not just authors, but all the people\nwho could be or want to be authors in all the different\nlanguages of the world, and I think if you could do this,\nit would be called -- I'm just going to refer to it\nas a knowledge ecosystem. So, really, this is the dream, and in a sense what you can think of it is we're trying\nto enable anyone in the world, I mean anyone in the world -- "},{"time":"03:55","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"03:56","text":"to be their own educational DJ, creating educational materials,\nsharing them with the world, constantly innovating on them. So, this is the dream. "},{"time":"04:04","text":"In fact, this dream\nis actually being realized. Over the last six-and-a-half years, we've been working really hard\nat Rice University on a project called Connexions, and so what I'd like to do\nfor the rest of the talk is just tell you a little bit about what people are doing\nwith Connexions, which you can kind of\nthink of as the counterpoint to Nicholas Negroponte's talk yesterday, where they're working on the hardware\nof bringing education to the world. We're working on the open-source tools and the content. So, that's sort of\nto put it in perspective here. "},{"time":"04:33","text":"So, create. What are some of the people\nthat are using these kind of tools? Well, the first thing is, there's a community\nof engineering professors, from Cambridge to Kyoto, who are developing engineering content\nin electrical engineering to develop what you can think of\nas a massive, super textbook that covers the entire area\nof electrical engineering. And not only that -- it can be customized for use in each\nof their own individual institutions. If people like Kitty Jones, a shut-out -- a private music teacher and mom\nfrom Champagne, Illinois, who wanted to share her fantastic\nmusic content with the world, on how to teach kids how to play music -- Her material is now used\nover 600,000 times per month. Tremendous use. In fact, a lot of this use coming\nfrom United States K-12 schools, because anyone who's involved\nin a school scale back, the first thing that's cut\nis the music curriculum. And so this is just indicating\nthe tremendous thirst for this kind of open, free content. A lot of teachers are using this stuff. "},{"time":"05:41","text":"What about ripping?\nWhat about copying, reusing? A team of volunteers\nat the University of Texas at El Paso -- graduate students translating\nthis engineering super textbook ideas. And within about a week, having this be some\nof our most popular material in widespread use all over Latin America,\nand in particular in Mexico, because of the open,\nextensible nature of this. People, volunteers and even companies that are translating materials\ninto Asian languages like Chinese, Japanese and Thai, to spread the knowledge even further. "},{"time":"06:15","text":"OK, what about people who are mixing? What does \"mixing\" mean? \"Mixing\" means\nbuilding customized courses, means building customized books. Companies like National Instruments, who are embedding very powerful,\ninteractive simulations into the materials, so that we can go way beyond\nour regular kind of textbook to an experience that all the teaching materials\nare things you can actually interact with and play around with\nand actually learn as you do. "},{"time":"06:44","text":"We've been working\nwith Teachers Without Borders, who are very interested\nin mixing our materials. They're going to be using\nConnexions as their platform to develop and deliver teaching materials\nfor teaching teachers how to teach in 84 countries around the world. TWB is currently in Iraq, training 20,000 teachers\nsupported by USAID. And to them, this idea\nof being able to remix and customize to the local context\nis extraordinarily important, because just providing\nfree content to people has actually been likened\nby people in the developing world to a kind of cultural imperialism -- that if you don't empower people with the ability\nto re-contextualize the material, translate it into their own language\nand take ownership of it, it's not good. "},{"time":"07:32","text":"OK, other organizations\nwe've been working with, UC Merced -- people know about UC Merced. It's a new university in California,\nin the Central Valley, working very closely\nwith community colleges. They're actually developing a lot of their science\nand engineering curriculum to spread widely\naround the world in our system. And they're also trying to develop\nall of their software tools completely open-source. We've been working with AMD,\nwhich has a project called 50x15, which is trying to bring\nInternet connectivity to 50 percent of the world's\npopulation by 2015. We're going to be\nproviding content to them in a whole range of different languages. And we've also been working\nwith a number of other organizations. In particular, a bunch of the projects\nthat are funded by Hewlett Foundation, who have taken a real leadership role\nin this area of open content. "},{"time":"08:24","text":"OK, burn -- I think\nthis is, sort of, quite interesting. \"Burn\" is the idea of trying\nto create the physical instantiation of one of these courses. And I think a lot of you received -- I think all of you received one\nof these music books in your gift pack. A little present for you. Just to tell you quickly about it:\nthis is an engineering textbook. It's about 300 pages long, hardbound. This costs -- anybody guess? How much would it cost in a bookstore? "},{"time":"08:57","text":"(Audience) 65 dollars. "},{"time":"08:58","text":"Richard Baraniuk:\nOK. This costs 22 dollars to the student. Why does it cost 22 dollars? Because it's published on demand and it's developed\nfrom this repository of open materials. If this book were to be published\nby a regular publisher, it would cost at least 122 dollars. "},{"time":"09:16","text":"So what we're seeing is moving this burning\nor publication process from the regular,\nsort of single-authored book towards community-authored materials that are modular, that are customized\nto each individual class and published on demand\nvery inexpensively, either pushed out through Amazon or published directly\nthrough an on-demand press, like QOOP. And I think that this is\nan extraordinarily interesting area because there is tremendous area\nunder this long tail in publishing. We're not talking\nabout the Harry Potter end, right at the left side. We're talking about books on hypergeometric\npartial differential equations. Books that might sell\n100 copies a year, 1,000 copies a year. There is tremendous\nsustaining revenue under this long tail to sustain open projects like ours, but also to sustain this new emergence\nof on-demand publishers, like QOOP, who produced these two books. And I think one of the things\nthat you should take away from this talk is that there's an impending\ncut-out-the-middle-man disintermediation, that's going to be happening\nin the publishing industry. And it's going to reach a crescendo\nover the next few years, and I think that it's for our benefit,\nreally, and for the world's benefit. "},{"time":"10:31","text":"OK, so what are the enablers? What's really making all of this happen? There's tons of technology, and the only piece of technology\nthat I really want to talk about is XML. How many people know about XML? Oh, great. So it's the future of the web, right? It's semantic representation of content. And what you can really\nthink of XML in this case is it's the packaging\nthat we're putting around these pages. Remember we took the book,\ntore the pages out? Well, what the XML is going to do is it's going to turn those pages\ninto Lego blocks. XML are the nubs on the Lego that allow us to combine the content\ntogether in a myriad different ways, and it provides us a framework\nto share content. So, it lets you take this ecosystem in its primordial state\nof all this content, all the pages you've torn out of books, and create highly sophisticated\nlearning machines: books, courses, course packs. "},{"time":"11:27","text":"It gives you the ability\nto personalize the learning experience to each individual student, so that every student\ncan have a book or a course that's customized to their\nlearning style, their context, their language and the things\nthat excite them. It lets you reuse the same materials\nin multiple different ways, and surprising new ways. It lets you interconnect ideas, indicating how fields\nrelate to each other. And I'll just give you my personal story. We came up with this\nsix-and-a-half years ago because I teach the stuff in the red box. "},{"time":"12:01","text":"And my day job, as Chris said --\nI'm an electrical engineering professor. I teach signal processing and my challenge\nwas to show that this math -- Wow, about half of you\nhave already fallen asleep just looking at the equation. "},{"time":"12:13","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"12:14","text":"But this seemingly dry math is actually the center\nof this tremendously powerful web that links technology -- that links really cool applications\nlike music synthesizers to tremendous economic opportunities, but also governed\nby intellectual property. And the thing that I realized is there was no way\nthat I, as an engineer, could write this book\nthat would get all of this across. We needed a community to do it and we needed new tools\nto be able to interconnect these ideas. And I think that really,\nin a sense, what we're trying to do is make Minsky's dream come to a reality, where you can imagine\nall the books in a library actually starting to talk to each other. And people who are teachers out here --\nwhoever taught, you know this -- it's the interconnections between ideas\nthat teaching is really all about. "},{"time":"13:00","text":"OK, back to math. Imagine -- this is possible: that every single equation that you\nclick on in one of your new e-texts is something that you're going to be able\nto explore and experiment with. So imagine your kid's\nalgebra textbook in seventh grade. You can click on every single equation and bring up a little tool\nto be able to experiment with it, tinker with it, understand it. Because we really\ndon't understand until we do. The same type of mark-up,\nlike MathML, for chemistry. Imagine chemistry textbooks that actually understand the structure\nof how molecules are formed. Imagine Music XML that actually lets you delve\ninto the semantic structure of music, play with it, understand it. It's no wonder that everybody's\ngetting into it, right? Even the three wise men. "},{"time":"13:47","text":"(Laughter) "},{"time":"13:49","text":"OK, the second big enabler,\nand this is where I told a big lie. The second big enabler\nis intellectual property. Because, in fact, I got up here and I talked about how great\nthe music culture is. We can share and rip, mix and burn,\nbut in fact, that's all illegal. And we would be accused\nof [piracy] for doing that, because this music has been propertized. It's now owned,\nmuch of it by big industries. So, really, the key thing here\nis we can't let this happen. We can't let this\nNapster thing happen here. So, what we have to do\nis get it right from the very beginning. And what we have to do\nis find an intellectual property framework that makes sharing safe\nand makes it easily understandable. And the inspiration here\nis taken from open-source software. Things like Linux and the GPL. "},{"time":"14:40","text":"The Creative Commons licenses. How many people\nhave heard of creative commons? If you have not, you must learn about it. Creativecommons.org. At the bottom of every piece\nof material in Connexions and in lots of other projects, you can find their logo. Clicking on that logo\ntakes you to an absolute no-nonsense, human-readable document, a deed, that tells you exactly\nwhat you can do with this content. In fact, you're free to share it,\nto do all of these things: to copy it, to change it,\neven to make commercial use of it, as long as you attribute the author. Because in academic publishing\nand much of educational publishing, it's really this idea of sharing knowledge and making impact. That's why people write,\nnot necessarily making bucks. We're not talking\nabout Harry Potter, right? We're at the long tail end here. Behind that is the legal code,\nvery carefully constructed. "},{"time":"15:37","text":"And Creative Commons is taking off -- over 43 million things out there, licensed with a Creative Commons license. Not just text, but music, images, video. And there's actually a tremendous uptake of the number of people\nthat are actually licensing music to make it free for people\nwho do this whole idea of re-sampling, ripping, mixing, burning and sharing. "},{"time":"16:02","text":"OK, I'd like to conclude\nwith just the last few points. So, we've built this idea of a commons. People are using it. We get over 500,000 unique visitors\nper month, just to our particular site. MIT OpenCourseWare,\nwhich is another large open-content site, gets a similar number of hits. But how do we protect this? How do we protect it into the future? And the first thing\nthat people are probably thinking is quality control, right? Because we're saying that anybody\ncan contribute things to this commons. Anybody can contribute anything. So that could be a problem. "},{"time":"16:40","text":"It didn't take long until people\nstarted contributing materials, for example, on lingerie, which is actually a pretty good module. The only problem is it's plagiarized\nfrom a major French feminist journal, and when you go\nto the supposed course website, it points to a lingerie-selling website. So this is a little bit of a problem. So we clearly need some kind\nof idea of quality control and this is really where the idea\nof review and peer review comes in. You come to TED. Why do you come to TED? Because Chris and his team have ensured that things are\nvery, very high quality, right? And so we need to be able\nto do the same thing. And we need to be able\nto design structures, and what we're doing\nis designing social software to enable anyone to build\ntheir own peer review process, and we call these things \"lenses.\" And basically what they allow is anyone out there can develop\ntheir own peer-review process, so that they can focus\non the content in the repository that they think is really important. And you can think of TED\nas a potential lens. "},{"time":"17:46","text":"So I'd just like to end by saying: you can really view this\nas a call to action. Connexions and open content\nis all about sharing knowledge. All of you here are tremendously imbued\nwith tremendous amounts of knowledge, and what I'd like to do\nis invite each and every one of you to contribute to this project\nand other projects of its type, because I think together\nwe can truly change the landscape of education and educational publishing.
